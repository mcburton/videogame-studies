		<description>I really like this closing question about possibly remaking a &quot;hard core&quot; game as a casual game. There&#039;s a style of game design called &quot;demakes&quot;---adopting a modern game for an earlier platform, like &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; for the Atari VCS---and that might be one way to turn a serious game into a casual game. 

As an aside, this would also be a neat idea to pursue for the final project!</description>

		<description>I agree, the game is not really a simulation. But what do you think about the other titles the game gives itself: &quot;a toy world&quot; and &quot;a newsgame.&quot; What do each of these titles suggest?</description>

		<description>I think you&#039;re onto something about the difficulty of using a medium that &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; action (as Galloway made clear in his first chapter) to promote relaxation or even meditation. I guess there are two responses to this critique: (1) is there a way games can foster stillness over motion? And (2) can repetitive actions ever be relaxing? I think of something like knitting, which I know a lot of people find relaxing, almost meditative, even though it requires skill and physical activity.</description>

		<description>I would definitely agree that the same logic would apply to video games because video games often require the user to accept an alternative reality that is very different from true reality.  Thus, people who regard the game as trivial and refuse to play would be extremely damaging to the game world because of the fact that a video game is based on the user accepting the general premise of the game.  Therefore, the power of dismissive thinking is greater with video games than for games such as card games, where there is not such a leap of imagination required in order for the game to progress.</description>

		<description>I am afraid to spoil one of the story arcs for you, but the name of the book is &quot;Oghma Infinium&quot;. The difference for me is the role-playing aspect of Skyrim. You start off weak and puny, progressively becoming stronger as you fight enemies. There is hardly an effort to be made when receiving an RPG in GTA. You instantly become stronger rather than working towards it. I feel that shooters are starting to recognize the &quot;leveling up&quot; aspect of video games such as COD and BF3, games that make you play in order to unlock essential guns and additions to make you stronger.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m reluctant to rely entirely on a basic supply and demand graph to explain the videogame crash in the early 80s. Certainly there was an abundance of games (and an overabundance of not very good games), but there were many other factors at work. Some of the largest companies made bad investments. Fluctuating manufacturing costs played a role. And perhaps the biggest disruptor of the videogame market was the emergence of home computers. So it wasn&#039;t just that there was too little demand; in fact, there was a great demand, but much of it shifted to the much more versatile early PCs.</description>

		<description>Wondering what the reaction to videogame violence would have been if the early games had been set in more realistic environments is an intriguing &lt;em&gt;what if?&lt;/em&gt; question. It&#039;d be worth looking at a roster of early arcade and console games and figure out the ratio of realistic to fantastic games, and then determine which ones had caused an outrage. One of the earliest protests against violent videogames involved the non science-fictiony &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Race_%28video_game%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Death Race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;---all the way back in 1976!</description>

		<description>My first impulse upon reading this post is to ask, what&#039;s the book and where do I find it. But then I stop myself, knowing that---as you found out---when games become too easy they also become boring.

Yet there&#039;s a paradox, as you imply. There are plenty of cheats in &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt; that give the player-character god-like powers. In this case, though, the game doesn&#039;t become dull; it can in fact become more interesting to play. So what&#039;s the difference between &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;?</description>

		<description>This question of cheating also made me think of what Caillois said about the cheater not being nearly as threatening to the game as the nihilist who refuses to play. Do you think the same logic holds true when talking about videogames (as opposed to, say, card games)?</description>

		<description>That&#039;s a very good question about how far can a game push its non-diegetic acts without becoming something other than a game. Aside from the case of Jodi (which we&#039;ll read more about later this semester), I wonder if there are other, more mainstream games (sports, board, or video) in which the non-diegetic acts threaten to overwhelm the diegetic ones. (Side note: Huizinga didn&#039;t actually call Jodi &quot;spoilsports&quot;; Galloway just means to say that according to Huizinga&#039;s definitions, that&#039;s what Jodi would appear to be.)</description>
