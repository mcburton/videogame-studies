<p style="margin-top: 10px">The reading this week, titled &#8220;Interactive Fiction,&#8221; discussed what encompasses Interactive Fiction. It involves a text-based role playing game in which you can give a variety of different commands (such as touch, smell, exit, go north, etc.) to the player. You can explore the world through using these various commands.</p>
<p>For instance, in the game Bronze you set in the scene of a medieval castle. You can explore different rooms in the castle by going north, south, east or west. The game starts out by telling you about a &#8220;Beast,&#8221; with whom you are well acquainted. You can explore various rooms in the castle, such as the State Rooms, the kitchen, the Tower, and many others.</p>
<p>What is interesting about this game is that for the player to become aware of their digital world they must actively look, smell, take, or perform some other action. Items can also be obtained or manipulated within a given space (Montfort defines <em>rooms</em> vs <em>locations</em> and <em>areas</em>). So within a particular room there can be a sword, shield, or spear that the player can use to help them complete the game. Montfort defines rooms as &#8220;a simulated place from which a certain set of elements in the IF world can be sensed, manipulated, or otherwise acted upon.&#8221;</p>
<p>These games in a way achieve more than the high resolution HD graphics of many games today. Because the only thing visible to the player is the text, it leaves the appearance of the digital world up to the imagination of the gamer. No two people are going to mentally construct the castle in Bronze the same way. In this respect, then, do games like Bronze achieve better visuals than games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 3? After all, the images the human imagination produces is hard to compete with.. What is more realistic: a room digitally constructed by programmers or one produced by the human imagination?</p>

The first test is called the Plinkett Test and is performed by describing a character without referencing their appearance, profession, or what they do in the story. The goal of the test is to see if the character developed is more than just basic descriptions. A successful character is one that the players of the game can relate to if that is the intention of the author. Some games take a different approach depending on how the story is portrayed. The second test is called the Bechdel Test and is used as a test of female characterization. The three requirements to pass the Bachdel Test are: it has two or more women in it, they talk to each other, and about something other than a man. The point of this test is to avoid the stereotypical female roles in dramatic storytelling, and to make those females strong well-rounded characters.</p>

Laura Packer first and foremost is a story teller, and a phenomenal one at that. In her presentation she outlined the history of storytelling and how it is the human races first real form of communication, dating back to prehistoric times. Story telling taps into a experiential part of your brain and makes you tap into your experiences and past to help make a story your own.</p>
<p>Ms. Packer told the audience a story about the day she met the devil. The devil didn&#8217;t have red horns or a long pointed tail. The devil also didn&#8217;t smell like brim stone, but rather Channel number 5. This was just the very beginning of her story but as you can see your senses and imagination are already at work. You can almost smell the Channel perfume or brim stone when you are told this information. Ms. Packer never actually tells you what the devil fully looks like but rather gives you little pieces and allows you to fill in the rest. The blank space that she leaves for you to use to create your own image is what she calls &#8220;white space&#8221;. It is this &#8220;white space&#8221; that allows you to become deeply emerged into a story by adding your own twist or perception of it, and in turn makes the story more of your own.</p>
<p>In regards to gaming, she argues that gaming is very good at telling a story, but how good is it emerging you into it and making you own the story yourself. Often video games give you every little detail from the characters outfit to the fight scenes to whats happening and so on. She challenged all the game designers to try to make games that they could leave enough white space somehow in order to make each story their own. She figured the plot of the story would be a good place to start, but she also wasn&#8217;t too sure how this could fully be done. In looking at games with alternate endings based off the choices you make in the game, she found that this was the closest to the idea she was looking for. However, the games endings are not truly all endless based on the players choices. There are a set number. Unfortunately right now we do not have the technology to make a game with a purely infinite number of endings.</p>
<p>In regards to how I felt about her presentation, I loved it. She was very entertaining and engaged the audience in a way that i hadn&#8217;t expected. I would suggest that if anyone gets the chance to listen to her again then they should take that opportunity.</p>

I&#8217;ll be going, fingers crossed, into the games industry as a game artist, but I&#8217;ve had a little taste of game writing in one of Seth Hudson&#8217;s classes and I really like it. Laura Packer&#8217;s morning workshop was a good way to ease into the day. The woman is a very talented storyteller, and the creative exercises she had us participate in really began renewing my interest in creative writing, which I haven&#8217;t done in a while. She had us doing goofy improv games in groups to stir up ideas and create some really off-the-wall stories. What she stressed, here, was the importance of having a group to brainstorm with and bounce ideas off of, because collaboration is really where the best story elements are conjured in conjunction with improv; we&#8217;ll often come up with more novel ideas when put on the spot in a group setting and BSing the next line of a narrative.</p>
<p>The importance of having a group of people to bounce ideas off of was a point emphasized also by Rowland Cox. He stressed the importance of having a &#8220;circle of trust&#8221;; a group of people who will listen to you and give you constructive criticism on your ideas. The industry can be cruel, and maturing your ideas with a small group of others first and thickening your rhino skin will help you succeed more in the industry. The biggest thing he talked about, though, was passion. You&#8217;ve got to love what you do. You&#8217;ve got to know what you love about it. You&#8217;ve got to be able to pull from an arsenal of references, whether they be textual, gamic, or filmic in nature, to get across to others what you love. This probably hit truest to what I lack currently. I have a huge passion for video games (and making them), and going to see all the recent Marvel films in sequence before I watch the Avengers already makes me giddy as a kid on Christmas day, I haven&#8217;t thought too deeply about why I love what I love. The passion&#8217;s there, I just need to find it&#8217;s source, and I relish that advice. Anyway, I really liked that he asked the audience members questions, too, engaging them in conversation. It was refreshing and the atmosphere was nice.</p>
<p>Ken Rolston, though, wow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been to such an energetic presentation before. He was honest, he was fun, he was unafraid, and he shone as brightly as the sun with lethal positivity. He stressed a lot of things- the importance of collecting literature, flyers, etc. to use as references, learning from tabletop games, maintaining an excessively positive attitude in the workplace to get what you want, failing fast, hard, and dramatically, stealing stuff, and the power of donuts. It was incredibly fast-paced, and he had a lot of information to give, but what I absorbed was very helpful and I have a lot of respect for the man. He terrifies me just a wee bit (that extreme positivity and confidence helps, I think) but I admire the way he operates and I think that&#8217;s something to aspire to. He came out of retirement to keep working on and perfecting games; you can see that he loves what he does.</p>

But one genre that has been overlooked is interactive fiction. Unlike traditional games, interactive fiction is a text based game that is not concerned with aesthetics or poetics. The focus is on action and reaction by the program to guide you through some world. As Nick Montfort wrote, many view Interactive Fiction as a work of fiction rather than a game of fiction.</p>
<p>Some arguments in favor of interactive fiction being classified a game would be the ability for interactivity of a player with the machine. Player inputs are diegetic actions that define most games. Interactive fiction is played not by randomly typing in words but by using specific verbs. These action words give a sense of “playing” the fiction rather than reading a work of fiction.  Interactive fiction also textually simulates worlds. Videogames are known for simulated reality which parallels interactive fiction.</p>
<p>Unlike a traditional game there are many aspects of “gaming” that is limited or completely excluded in interactive fiction. An interactive fiction is a world that can be explored but has no quest. There is no concept of winning or final replay.  This is similar to the “games” we have explored in the past like driving the bus for 8 hours gives you 1 point but no clear winner, and the Mario clouds game that offer no quest but visual appeal. Would we classify these as games? If so, then should we then consider interactive fictions to be games as well?</p>

<p>MC Frontalot (and to a similar extent, the video editor Jason Scott) demonstrates an understanding of what makes the text adventure so very fun.</p>
<p>Which is sort of the odd thing, text adventures aren&#8217;t really gone, they&#8217;ve just had to adapt to a changing world. Unfortunately, the only game of the type I can readily come up with an example for has lewd content. Originally titled Softporn Adventure, Leisure Suit Larry was a &#8220;classic&#8221; text adventure of the time, and several games later it has had two unsuccessful (pornographic games don&#8217;t sell well) outings in 3D, with both traditional text adventure elements and the introduction of coordination tests. Who knew watching X-play back when it was on techTV could come in handy. Interestingly, according to wikipedia, the latest game in the series features no nudity or explicit sexual situations.</p>
<p>After that little sidetrack, let&#8217;s get back to the point.</p>
<p>Interactive Fiction is mostly worth noting as, while not the first form of video game, it was the most prolific for a long period of time, and helped flesh out the concept of a video game, as more than just a coordination test, a la Pac Man; Asteroids; etc. This bleed-back can be seen as early as the game Sinistar. Compare:<br />
Asteroids: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZfsnA7dAHI<br />
Sinistar: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcyBtVwAsfg &#8211; Please watch Sinistar with SOUND</p>
<p>What I am arguing here is that interactive fiction not only made puzzling a part of video games, but also made story an integral function. Sinistar is not merely a particularly powerful and frustrating opponent, but also an entity. He has a philosophy: http://onastick.net/drew/sinistar/ yet ultimately the gameplay is functionally on par with that of Asteroids.</p>
<p>He is also beyond terrifying in a video-game concept. Dwarfing your ship, Sinistar is an organic entity with a single-minded purpose, being to destroy you, and he is faster than you. Fortunately, you have ranged weapons he lacks, and his cornering could use some work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honestly not sure what else I can say about Interactive Fiction. It&#8217;s another genre of gaming, an old genre that many feel is dead. I almost feel like they&#8217;re more interesting for their narrative choices and incomprehensible methodology than as a game.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a few gems from interactive fiction:<br />
One of the King&#8217;s Quest games allowed you to pick locks, and become proficient at it. You could also pick your nose. If you were below a certain skill level, you would jam the lockpick up your nose and into your brain, killing you instantly. Above that level, you could practice your lockpicking skill by picking your nose. &#8220;Your Nose Is Now Open&#8221;</p>
<p>Another game had you meet a dragon, as many games did.<br />
&gt;Kill Dragon<br />
   What with, your bare hands?<br />
&gt;Yes<br />
Congratulations! You killed a dragon! Ain&#8217;t that something? ~(this line is paraphrased)</p>

He was speaking in order to inspire future game developers or writers, to give them advice and first-hand knowledge on what a job in the gaming industry is like today. He focused on five main takeaways that the audience should remember and utilize in their own careers.</p>
<p>1. Have an Indestructible Passion. Love what you do, and persevere.</p>
<p>2. Have a &#8220;Death Star Exploding&#8221; imagination. Innovative thoughts and their proper application are what sets successful games apart. He gave lists of books, movies, and games which he saw as influential and necessary to being well-read.</p>
<p>3. Know Thyself. Know what you love, what inspires you, what your childhood fantasies were.</p>
<p>4. Share Your Joy. Take your inspirations and fantasies and share them through your art.</p>
<p>5. Have a Circle of Trust. A close group of friends in which you can trust your unfinished ideas and greatest passions. These people can help you develop and review your ideas before you share them publicly.</p>
<p>He views all of these points as key to his successful career, and wishes to share them with the next generation of game developers, who he views as holding the future of the form of gaming in their hands. He finds that art happens accidentally, and comes from entertainment that reaches the next level of form.</p>

I do not find interactive fiction to be a videogame, regardless of whether or not it was intended to be one. Making it through the presented fictional story and memorizing the different commands felt like more of a chore rather than a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>The one thing I do appreciate about these games is their history. Because some of the first interactive fiction games have been around since the 1970&#8242;s, like <em>Adventure</em>, it feels as though I am getting a raw and classic experience. It makes me feel as though I am interacting with the basic logistics of a computer more so when compared to a complex modern videogame. Although I do see why interaction fiction generates interest, its not an experience that I will ever strive to obtain.</p>

The ones that stuck out most to me were Ken Rolston’s key note presentation, Laura Pecker’s workshop; Improvisational Story Telling for Game Development, and Keaven Freeman’s workshop; Quest Crafting: Maximizing Impact without a Wall of Text. Ken’s speech was really interesting and I never thought that so much about game writing can be learned from table top and paper game storytelling and overall design. As a want to be Game Designer I found that he had a lot of really good points for writing story for RPG’s, which as he said is the hardest genre of game to write for. I was a little disappointed that his presentation and all the others that I attended focused on writing for the genre of RPG or MMORPG. It would have been nice to get a taste of how writing may be different when you are working with  designing a Strategy game, First Person Shooter, Point and Click adventure, etc.</p>
<p>	What I loved so much about Laura Pecker’s workshop was that it was fun, and really helped me find my inner creativity. For those of you who did not attend we did small group collective story telling exercises that focused on speed and unpredictability. She said that whenever you find yourself stuck in a rut with your plot or a character, to try out one of these exercises to see what possibilities you can come up with.</p>
<p>	Keaven Freeman’s workshop was about designing quests that are fairly deep and complex, and how to streamline events and dialogue so that you do not bore the player with walls of text explaining what they must do. He said that the best way to say things about your game world or characters is to not say it at all. Instead of telling a player that a character does this or that, show them and have other characters in the world react and talk about things to give the player a hint without spilling the beans in front of  them outright. This was a point also made by Seamus Sullivan in his presentation on good dialogue. In all I felt that I learned a lot about game and character design,  tools to good storytelling and dialogue, writer to player relations, and a bunch about what exactly it means to be a writer or designer for a game. </p>

Until I played Flight to Freedom rarely had I thought about the everyday hardships of slavery and how decision to escape would affect the life of a slave. I rarely considered what I would do without an education to help guide me through my decision making processes. But all these things and more are highlighted when Frasca asks us to take Boalian approach to games as is taken in theater. However, one must be careful with such an approach when it comes to learning about history (as Frasca states with an Anne Frank example). Because of the role that video games play in shaping a player&#8217;s sense of reality through immersion it is critical that video games not assume the role of documentary as espoused by Raessens. As Raessens quotes in his article, &#8220; Documentary computer games are capable of opening the area of the historical documentary to a large audience and may become very popular judging from the enthusiasm with which computer games generally are played and discussed&#8221;. Because of the educational effect&#8221; video games can have it is important not to fill them with inaccuracies. If a video games about the JFK assassination is the only place a fourteen year-old learns about this tragedy in our country&#8217;s history let it not be an inaccurate game. Because video games can assume the role of documentary games, when they do, they should be accurate.</p>

He argues that their interactive nature makes video games more akin to a simulation than to a narrative, and uses this perspective as a starting point to discuss how their potential for social critique might be better realized. To that end, he introduces Augusto Boal&#8217;s &#8220;Theater of the Oppressed,&#8221; which attempts to blend the roles of actor and spectator by methods such as &#8220;Forum Theater.&#8221; Boal&#8217;s &#8220;Forum Theater&#8221; consists of a group of people acting out a previously unscripted scene from some starting scenario; the initial scenario always presents some form of oppression or social conflict against the protagonist. When a person in the group thinks of a possible course of action for the protagonist, that person would share their idea by acting it out in character of the protagonist. This roundtable method of acting out a developing scene offers an interesting medium for discussion, and Frasca goes on to provide examples of how this might be achieved with video games. His adaptation of Boal&#8217;s methods to what Frasca calls &#8220;Forum Videogames&#8221; is a notably different approach to the topic than most we&#8217;ve encountered thus far, as it embraces the adaptive, non-narrative aspects of gameplay; the approach definitely parallels Galloway&#8217;s idea of &#8220;procedural rhetoric,&#8221; but involves a higher level of direct social involvement and discussion.</p>

The article itself was written back in 2004 so the author might be surprised by the ongoing maturity of video games. While many big blockbuster video games of late focus on saving Earth from intergalactic villains or running over pedestrians, online flash games and indie games have show unique story-telling.</p>
<p>Two flash games, whose names are impossible to find current, come to mind. One of them has the user playing as a soldier escorting a citizen through a beautiful South Pacific landscape. At the end of this lengthy walk similar to that of <em>Passage,</em> the user must decide whether or not to kill the citizen or let them free. If the user allows the citizen to live, his character returns back to the village to be killed. The purpose of the flash game was to educate about the horrors of genocide that also took place in the South Pacific in the 1970&#8242;s. Another game starts off as man getting ready for work. The player plays as a middle-age man preparing for work in New York City. The player can make a wide variety of small decisions throughout the journey. However, no matter what, the player arrives at work only to realize that the date is September 11th, 2001 and the man works at the World Trade Center. Both games has the user active participate in the simulation of the game; however, the ending of both games has the user sit back and critically assess life. Whether it is about the tragedies of genocide and war, or the fragility of life and how short it can be,  the user is forced to come to a conclusion about his or her own life. As games continue to mature as well as the progression of the modern day gamer, it would not be surprising to see simulation and critical thinking to fully merge in the future.</p>

This was particularly interesting, as it explores how video games can be used to help people gain a better understanding of reality and encourage critical thinking about important social and political issues.</p>
<p>Frasca provides a good example to illustrate his point that video games can promote a better understanding of reality. The example he uses is the popular <em>Sims </em>game, which allows a player to control his or her Sim or Sim family. Within this, Frasca discusses forums and modified versions of characters, such as &#8220;Dave&#8217;s Alcoholic Mother version 0.9&#8243; which allows a player to experiment with personalities and habits of characters that may be less than ideal. Alcoholism, in this case, could have a negative effect on the family. Additionally, as Frasca mentions, a player could have the ability to further modify his or her character&#8217;s habits if he or she isn&#8217;t satisfied with the level of realism displayed by her character (such as taking liquor out of a liquor cabinet instead of hiding places around a house, which is more typical of an alcoholic).</p>
<p>Also important was Frasca&#8217;s mention of video games being a tool that could be used to encourage critical thinking about current political and social issues. This idea ties heavily into material we covered in class, where we played <em>September 12</em>. <em>September 12 </em>illustrates perfectly the idea that video games can be used to offer political commentary, as a player is put in a position to kill &#8220;terrorists&#8221; in a heavily populated urban center, with civilians dressed in Islamic-style clothing interspersed. If the player kills civilians while attempting to kill a terrorist, other civilians will cry over the dead bodies of their compatriots and turn into terrorists. This means that, at any one time, a player could kill a single civilian and a single terrorist and end up <em>creating</em> three more terrorists from the grieving civilians. This is meant to highlight perceived failures (such as civilian casualties from aerial bombings) of the American War on Terror, failures that many people claim to have created more terrorists.</p>
<p>However, Frasca stops there, and will not go so far as to say that video games create social change. As <em>September 12 </em>illustrated for our section of Honors 353, video games can make us think about and debate the issues of our day, but they do not carry the kind of weight to stop bombings that kill large numbers of civilians.</p>
