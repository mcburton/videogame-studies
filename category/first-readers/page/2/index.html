I&#8217;ve been following the Total War series since the very first Shogun: Total War<br />
Then Medieval: Total War, the one I played for the longest period.</p>
<p>Both of the above, despite  their respectively taking place in Japan and Europe at critical points of strife, and having the map and factions to prove it, felt incredibly flat. Literally, in these two, you have an abstracted map of the region, like you had a paper map in front of you, and you move army tokens containing the actual forces around on this map. You pick them up, and put them where you want them. This abstraction, along with relatively light flavor, made the games sort of hollow beyond being a war game.</p>
<p>Enter Rome: Total War, and Medieval: Total War 2</p>
<p>These two overhauled the map system tremendously, now there are actual separate armies (still a single presence on a map) moving and having to pick paths and arrange ambushes and such, rather than literally being dropped into the next province. A lot of flavor starts to come into play, with voice acting and the usage of the Senate and Pope (respectively) as major bodies causing difficulties, it feels more cohesive and drawing.</p>
<p>Enter Total War: Shogun 2 (No I don&#8217;t know why they dropped the old naming formula)</p>
<p>When you start Total War: Shogun 2, this trailer plays as the very first thing after credits: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EQWcB1vXXg</p>
<p>It only delves further into the Japanese feel from there. Every spoken line in the game is, while English, in a mild Japanese accent. Loading screens offer beautiful, simple Japanese paintings with short snippets from The Art of War or haiku poetry or similar. A little Ninja movie plays every time you have someone assassinated, replete with such gems as a Ninja throwing a Kunai to hit his target in the back of the head, the target blocking it with a small fan out of nowhere, a cut to the Ninja with his eyes wide, as if to say &#8220;OH F@$*&#8221;, and subsequently running like a bat of hell, chased by guards. There are epic speeches at the start of battles, delivered with decent context-detection by your commanding officer on the field. E.g., they&#8217;ll have something snide to say about the shortcomings or over-specification of the clan in question, will praise the aid of any present allies, and so on.</p>
<p>All of this detail leaves you transported. It no longer feels as if you&#8217;re playing on a drab abstract map &#8211; most of the map actually is one when you start playing, but as you bring units to uncharted areas, they &#8220;pop&#8221; off the page into a realistic rendering of the landscape. Already obscenely long story short, Total War went from a run-of-the-mill wargame to a game that puts you in the mood of what you&#8217;re doing, and in doing so went from modestly successful to a front-page item on Steam.</p>

<p>In class on Tuesday, we talked extensively about how video games can be relaxing. Personally, I find video games to be relaxing when they provide the player with a pretty simple task. It becomes relaxing for me when performing that simple task in a video game allows me to completely focus entirely on the game while forgetting outside events or pressures. It is perfectly fine for the game to be challenging at some points, as long as the actions performed in order to play the game are very simple and understandable.</p>
<p><em>Sugar, Sugar </em>is a game that I find to be pretty relaxing. The controls and objectives are very easy to comprehend, but the game becomes more challenging as the player advances to further levels. The background music that accompanies the game also adds to its relaxing feel.</p>

Casual games are often looked at as examples of relaxation in video games. If the game is easy (which many casual games are, especially with habitual play) playing the game can almost become second nature and playing it can lead to relaxation. Some casual games that relax me are a version of brickbreaker-  <a href="http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/Arkanoid.html">http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/Arkanoid.html</a></p>
<p>and an online game introduced to me in this class, super mario bros three (ive heard of the game but started playing it regularly after it was assigned for the class) - <a href="http://www.virtualnes.com/play/?id=NES-UM&amp;s=10">http://www.virtualnes.com/play/?id=NES-UM&amp;s=10</a></p>
<p>when a casual game becomes second nature it seems less like an intense game of Call of Duty and more like knitting. Your mind can wander in relaxation, or you can take in and concentrate on other forms of media like music, podcasts or even a tv show on the other side of your computer screen. There are also relaxing games for consoles like Endless Ocean: Blue World (<a href="http://wii.ign.com/objects/142/14286532.html">http://wii.ign.com/objects/142/14286532.html</a>) that lets the player explore a relaxing environment at their own pace. Even though this game requires the same movements of pressing buttons as a more intense game, the guidelines aren&#8217;t as rigid and can provide a relaxing getaway from real life.</p>

He touches briefly on the hidden sex scenes in <em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas </em>and <em>Mass Effect</em>, but then goes on to talk about earlier sex-themed videogames from decades past in the United States. Later he talks at length about modern sex-themed games with a focus on Japanese hentai or eroge games. Over all, he makes the point that these games may not entirely be for the achievement of pleasure through an interactive, digital medium, but more for the achievement of a sense of discomfort in confronting the perversions enjoyed by other people or cultures. In other words, we might find Japanese interactive porn to be very disturbing, but elsewhere others might find the very detailed (well, as detailed as you could get at the time) porn games of our Atari age to be just as disturbing.</p>
<p>While I appreciate his scope of going into the past and across the seas in discussing this subject, I feel as though the chapter might have benefited from discussing more modern games in North America. I was really surprised he didn&#8217;t talk about the Sims games, to be quite honest. The whole concept of being able to make &#8220;woohoo&#8221; with another sim is something that I remember being quite controversial a number of years back. These games were out before this book was published, but not the Sims Social, a facebook game that enables you to play a 2D version of the Sims games with friends on the social networking site. What makes this different, though, from the other Sims games is that it has no (visible) rating. The other Sims games are rated T for teen because of the sexual aspects of the game and parents are able to monitor that. But anyone can have a facebook account, and therefore anyone of any age can play the much more cartoony and family-friendly looking Sims Social, yet I have heard no controversy over it at all. Could it be said, then, that games involving sexual content are becoming less controversial as they grow in numbers? Are things different now than from 7 years ago when <em>GTA: San Andreas </em>was criticized?</p>

He names a few games that were made for relaxation such as Wild Devine, Cloud and flow. From his descriptions it seems that Wild Devine is the only game that achieves its desired effect.  Since video games require physical interface there is a fine line between causing relaxation or frustration. This brings us back to a topic that we encountered earlier in the course, casual gaming. Casual games seem like they are made to produce the sensation of relaxation in their players. With the easy interface, interruptibility, and bright mood of causal games, they let the user play at any time without time commitment or stressfulness of more hardcore games. Bogost describes them as games where the player can just zone out and relax, similar to something such as doodling on paper. I completely agree with this statement. Whether I decide to relax by playing angry birds, listening to music, or even leisurely reading a book I can block out the outside world and completely zone out of reality. I think this is the appeal of the casual gaming market to its players. A casual game, even if it is hands on, can acquire the same desired effect as any form of relaxation depending on a person’s preferences. This cannot be confused with the concept of meditation. To successfully meditate “we must reject the principle of engagement” something that video games will never be capable of doing.</p>

<p>The game tried to label itself not as a game but as a simulation, that would shed light and insight and inspire inquiry into the subject of &#8220;the war on terror&#8221;. It claims that because one does not win or lose, only choose to shoot or not to shoot, that September 12th is not a game. Based on our understanding of diegetic and nondiegetic acts of games we know through the players interactions with it that this really is a game. We have played games before where the player does not really win or lose; Echo Bazaar, The Torture Game, and Dys4ia. The lack of the threat of loss or reward of victory does not strip September 12th of its label as a game, but what about its self proclaimed rank of &#8216;simulation&#8217;?</p>
<p>Simulation is defined as; the act of imitating the behavior of some situation or some process by means of something suitably analogous. Clearly the creators of September 12th are trying to share their opinions and thoughts on US foreign policy and Military Intervention around the world, particularly regarding post 9-11 terrorism. This game is in no way a suitably analogous process to that of the complexity of the side effects and backlash of civilian casualties to missile strikes against insurgent populations. I&#8217;m not trying to share my views on this subject one way or another, but I do strongly believe that September 12th does not deserve the title of &#8216;simulation&#8217;. The game vastly over simplifies a highly complex subject matter that cannot be accurately replicated with such simple tools. Saying September 12th &#8216;simulates&#8217; the war on terror is like saying Mario Kart simulates NASCAR or Spore simulates evolution and natural selection. It does create a  very basic sense of empathy and understanding of people who may be living in such situations, but really this game isn&#8217;t realistic or accurate enough to truly be called a simulation.</p>

At first glace I was intrigued by Bogost’s title, Texture, for the chapter. I really did not know what to expect given that in my mind texture meant tactile, something one touches, and in videogames you only touch the controller or the keys on a computer. It seemed odd that there would be anything else to add in terms of texture. After reading the chapter I realized that videogames create texture in a visual way with graphics and through the use of music and sound effects. Yet, what made me ponder further was this idea of user participation, Bogost’s says that participation is required in videogames. I think the participation he speaks of is more than the obvious participation as a player but in fact a participation of buying into what is actually being played. To some degree this reminds me of the ideas we have discussed in regards to film. In film an actor rarely breaks the fourth wall by speaking to the audience. Now personally when the fourth wall is broken it most often brings me in further to the movie given that I am being confronted by the actor and usually know something that another character may not know. I find that texture in fact does the same. Hence when a gamer feels the rumble of another car crashing into him in a race he does not just see it but feels it as well. To further the discussion in texture I would ask if the rumble in videogames is similar to that of 3D effects in film, why or why not?</p>
<p>Another note I would like to make is in regards to the chapter on Throwaways. Already having discussed casual games in class I found the Bogost added to the conversation by his three classifications of casual: indifferent, spontaneous or fleeting. More specifically, I thought that he makes a good point that casual games involve more total play time than ‘hardcore’ games and that these games almost need to resemble another game in order to more easily be picked up and played.  Thus, I’d like to pose the question, could a common ‘hardcore’ game be altered into a casual game? If so, what elements specifically would need to change? If not, why?</p>

Bogost states that videogames usually place us in roles that let us fulfill power fantasies by taking on powerful roles. However, he then states that this is not always the case. Every once in while a game will place the player in role of weakness. He gives examples of games such as Darfur is Dying and E.T. Both are games where the character is on who is helpless during the sequence and thus the player can experience empathy for them. Whether going to fetch water or running from FBI agents Bogost purports that a vantage point of weakness is what allows one to empathize with the games character or subject matter. I would venture to stretch this claim further.</p>
<p>At times a role of weakness is not necessary to cause the player to empathize with the character or subject matter. For example, when you play Madden there&#8217;s a mode known as Superstar mode. In Superstar mode you start as a rookie at the combine who is looking to play in the National Football League. You get drafted and work your way through an NFL career. The more work you put into training, practices, and working out the better your character becomes in the game. By requiring that players put in hours of practice and training in order to become elite NFL stars the makers of Madden make it possible for a player to empathize with the player in the actual NFL and the hard work it takes them to do well at what they do. So in causing a player to spend a similar amount of time investing in the end product the makers of Madden generate empathy from those who play the game. This is another that videogames cause us to walk in the shoes of others.</p>

Are videogames even art?  The second is a question he addresses in the first sentence of the chapter by which he quotes Roger Ebert.  Ebert says that &#8220;the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Ebert has given a decided opinion, ultimately no one can decide whether or not videogames are art because it depends on what each person&#8217;s individual definition.  Characteristics of art can include form, effect, perspective, skill involved as well as many others.  There are many types of games with varying strengths in these components.  How is good art different from bad art, and what makes each still considered art?  These questions are being applied to videogames, but they are difficult to ascertain.  With the avant-garde movement in the 19th century, these questions have become even more difficult to answer.</p>
<p>Videogames have filled a new niche in art just like film and poetry before it.  Although videogames as a form of art are not yet widely accepted, in a few decades, this stance will most likely change as technology becomes better and videogames continue to embed themselves within society.</p>
<p>Although the question can never be objectively answered, that&#8217;s the whole point.  Art is subjective, and it is the responsibility of the individual to determine the definition of art. Some videogames require immense skill and detail and whether or not they are considered art is up to you.</p>

<p>One use mentioned for videogames is that they can be a form of art, or an artgame.  Since art really doesn&#8217;t have any real boundaries or definitive meaning in modern times, this means that videogames can also be considered a form of art.  While there is game art, which is art that has elements of videogames but isn&#8217;t intended for play, artgames are meant to be played first and have an artistic meaning second.  A form of art that seems to be especially prevalent in artgames is Dada, which attempts to disrupt traditional notions of social and artistic conventions.  What&#8217;s interesting about Dada artgames is that by the pure absurdness that tends to be associated with this form, Dada sometimes combines two uses for videogames: art and pranks.  An example Ian Bogost give of this odd combination of videogame uses is &#8220;Cat-Mario,&#8221; also known as &#8220;Mario from Hell.&#8221;  This game defies all conventional knowledge of videogames, especially Super Mario Bros.  Hitting &#8220;?&#8221; blocks sometimes causes a monster to attack you, spikes will randomly pop up and kill your character, and eating mushrooms will sometimes turn you into a robot and plunge you to your death.  Basically, the game makes you take the least conventional routes in order to win the game.  While this is very much an exercise in disrupting the notions of how a videogame should be played, the game is also pranking the player by luring him/her into a sense of safety before Mario meets an odd and untimely death.  Similarly, you could also say that any use of pranking in a videogame could contain elements of the Dada art form, since the action of pranking in itself is disrupting your expectations of the game and how it should be played.  An example of pranking in a videogame that disrupts the normal conventions of gameplay is where the Eternal Darkness game&#8217;s insanity effect makes the player think that their saved game has been deleted.</p>

<p>In the chapter about music, the series Rock Band and Guitar Hero were panned for simplifying the instruments that were used to play the games.  However, the chapter mentions that a 2008 study done in the UK suggested that it was culturing an interest in music.  The study’s results said that one-half of people played music games, and one-fifth took up an interest in music after playing one of these games.  Frank Lantz stated that we should embrace this change.  Rock Band and Guitar Hero teach music in a method other than using an instrument: rhythm.  I like the fact that these games introduce the player to music by not learning how to use a specific instrument, but instead teaches them rhythm.  Rhythm is probably the most basic thing in music.  Without rhythm, there would be no music.  Rhythm help sets the mood of the piece that is being played, along with pitch and tone.  I played piano for about ten years, and my teachers always focused on the rhythm at which a piece was played.  For the first month or so of learning how to play the piano, I was only taught how to listen to the rhythm of the song, not even touching a piano.  I was then taught how to change between rhythms during a piece.  I believe these games are a positive influence on music, as without learning how to hear or feel rhythms, you cannot play any piece of music.</p>

<p>Bogost discusses the role of videogames in inspiring empathy, and mentions that some critics maintain that gamers are not interested in playing a “feeble character,” however, he remarks that it is interesting that people are interested in watching a <em>movie</em> about a feeble character.  This relates to the similarities and differences of video games and movies; videogames offer a stronger connection between the user and the experience than movies because the user actually has some degree of control in a videogame, they are more engaged.  Thus, a player would feel more frustration with a character’s weakness in a videogame because the character’s failure is more directly connected to a failure on the part of the player, whereas in movies, there is no such connection.  This furthers the general discussion of the difference between movies and videogames as highlighted in <em>“The Gaming Situation”, </em>which asserts that viewing computer games as descendants of theatre, drama and literature is fundamentally incorrect, and remarks on the differences between videogames and more narrative situations.</p>
<p>Another interesting point that Bogost brings up is with regards to pranking and one of its earliest forms in gaming, Easter eggs.  We have discussed how Atari was very open to game developers and Bogost highlights how the idea of an Easter egg arose from how Atari would often fail to give due credit to the game creators.  Essentially, the creators are trying to inject humanity into what, at first glance, appears to be a cold and calculating piece of technology.  In some ways, this ties back to the idea of a platform study because Easter eggs often force the user to consider what happened before the game; how it was developed and where it came from.  Easter eggs can be nondiegetic actions made by the creators (such as a hidden room with credits or secret messages); they often disrupt the narrative of the game and force the player to mentally leave the game world temporarily.  Perhaps it is this jolt out of “the zone” that gives Easter eggs their power to provoke thought in the user, and thus what make them such a good prank on the game’s publishers.</p>

As Wikipedia defines &#8220;A <em>core</em> or <em>mid-core</em> gamer is a player with a wide range of interests and enthusiast toward creative and diverse games, but without the amount of time spent and sense of competition of a hardcore gamer.&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer</a></p>
<p>This wide range of games and genres available on each console creates a large number of possibilities for gamer classifications. Even handheld game consoles can be host to casual and hardcore video games. Take into consideration the Gameboy Advance, and specifically two games, Super Mario Bros. 3 and Pokemon Emerald. One could argue that Super Mario Bros. 3 is a casual game, which doesn&#8217;t require much gaming knowledge to play, and offers playability in which the gamer can leave for an extended period of time, and still understand the objectives of the game, to get to the right side of the screen. Pokemon Emerald however, can be argued to be a hardcore game, because of the time and effort needed to successfully play the game, as well as the effort it takes to get back into the game upon returning from an extended break. These two levels of gaming are present in a console marketed for kids, and further blurs the lines between casual and hardcore.</p>
<p>Nintendo&#8217;s next console, the Wii U, is marketed for these &#8220;Mid-Core&#8221; gamers, who favor creativity and have wide ranges of interests in games and genres.</p>

He notes and expands on five characteristics of a game that determines its audience: positive or negative fiction, game usability, game interruptibility, difficulty and punishment, and the juiciness of a game. While these are all essential to the analysis of game users, I think that the author did not focus enough on the motivation of the gamers themselves.</p>
<p>I think that almost all gamers begin a game in order to escape from reality. Whether it&#8217;s boredom at work, a break from studying, enjoyment with peers, or any other reason, games ultimately provide for users an escape from their current reality. They do this by virtue of simulation. The better a game simulates an alternate reality, the more of an escape it can offer. Angry Birds and Left for Dead both provide an escape, but Left for Dead is a better simulation of an alternate reality, therefore it draws in more hardcore gamers.</p>
<p>The difference between casual and hardcore gamers then becomes the degree to which they wish to escape and the type of reality in which they wish to engage. A casual gamer who has little time to kill waiting in a doctor&#8217;s office wishes to escape the reality of waiting but only to a small degree so that other tasks can quickly be returned to. A hardcore high school gamer with few responsibilities and more available time will often wish to escape reality to a greater degree. The type of reality a player wishes to engage in is their preference for a positive or negative game world fiction.</p>
