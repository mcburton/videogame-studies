<p>Let&#8217;s take the game Terraria. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+Terraria</p>
<p>Is this game hardcore or casual? It&#8217;s bright and cheery during the day, and zombies will probably feast on your bones the first night. Your method of play completely changes the nature of the game. Whether you&#8217;re sculpting a beautiful castle or murdering bigger and nastier bosses for &#8220;phat loot&#8221;, Terraria lets you have it both ways.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s the fiction? Like I said, varies on what you&#8217;re doing, starts out positive.<br />
Interface? Mostly intuitive. Inventory management only becomes a problem after you&#8217;ve already gotten the hang of it.<br />
Interruptibility? Supremely interruptible. Obviously, less so if you&#8217;re with friends, or if you&#8217;re in the middle of fighting a boss monster.<br />
Difficulty? It starts out easy and gets harder, exactly as proscribed by both types of gamers.<br />
And the rewards are self-evident.</p>
<p>Even better, if you have a &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gamer friend more into the fighting aspects of the game, they can help you with those aspects of the game you&#8217;re not good at or interested in.</p>
<p>So Mister Know-it-all (that&#8217;s me): is this game hardcore or casual?</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t really class it as either. Your experience is tailored to what you want out of it.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to my thesis: Making this hardline distinction between hardcore and casual games is rather limiting.</p>
<p>Of course, some of what I&#8217;ve just said about these distinction is liberal idealist pinkocommie claptrap, and rightly so. Categorism is only &#8220;wrong&#8221; when it makes an incorrect or useless distinction. Probably, we can use this categorism to accomplish exactly what I&#8217;m getting at. &#8220;I shall make a game appealing to BOTH audiences! Hardcore and casual together at last! You got your hardcore in my casual, well you got your casual in my hardcore. . . mmmmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, and those of you who got this far and are wondering, where&#8217;s the Call of Duty? Where&#8217;s the Bejeweled? That was just to draw a parallel. Nothing to see here.</p>

On the other end of the spectrum would be the hardcore players who represent the reverse bias. But after reading the chapter it is clear that the stereotypes of casual players is misleading because studies show that casual players are similar to hardcore players in respects to game knowledge, time investments, and attitude towards difficulty.</p>
<p>The interesting finding was when the article discussed ex-hardcore gamers. The studies showed that ex-hardcore players suited the stereotype of &#8220;casual player&#8221; more than causal players did. The ex-hardcore players would be those who started as young hardcore players during the rise of the video-gaming era. As they grow up they have the same taste in fiction but are unable to invest the same amount of time as they used to and so their attitude towards difficulty changes. If that is the case, is it more appropriate to label ex-hardcore players as casual players?</p>
<p>The article mentions targeting women and stereotypical casual players who enjoy pleasant fictions but what kind of games are gaming industries creating to hold onto ex-hardcore players, who better suit the stereotype of &#8220;casual player&#8221;?</p>

<p>First, the author states that &#8220;casual games&#8221; are often built to be less complex and played for shorter periods of time than &#8220;hardcore games.&#8221; A representative of Nintendo even stated that many games for the Wii are downplaying the importance of graphics and other complexities of games in favor of simplicity in order to adhere to a broader audience of players. If games like these for the Wii and Xbox&#8217;s Kinect are indeed supposed to be less complex, then why do they still cost $50, which is similar to more &#8220;hardcore games&#8221; such as Skyrim or Battlefield? Is it because of the interactive technology required for the Wii controller or Kinect sensor to work? Personally, I choose to spend a certain amount of money on a new video game based on how much time I plan on playing it. I would love to purchase new Kinect games, but I am not willing to throw down $50 for a game that I would only casually play on an infrequent basis.</p>
<p>The author also mentions that casual games must have the ability to be played for both short and long periods of time. Players of the Rock Band games are able to play just a song or two for ten minutes, or they can also play for longer periods of time in game portions such as the &#8220;Endless Setlist,&#8221; where the gamers play all the songs in a row in one setting. This provides ideal entertainment for different players of casual games who spend varying amounts of time playing video games.</p>

<div style="width: 1px;height: 1px;padding: 0px;margin: -11px 0px 0px;border-width: 0px"></div>
<p style="margin-top: 10px">In the reading titled &#8220;Casual Revolution,&#8221; the author, Jesper Juul, talks about the difference between &#8220;casual&#8221; gaming and &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gaming. The casual gamer isn&#8217;t looking to get engrossed in a video game with advanced graphics and a complex system of controls. They&#8217;re looking to just have some fun. Whether they need to take a break from homework or just have some fun with friends on a Saturday night, these gamers don&#8217;t need to be won over by stunning gameplay or a thrilling storyline. On the other hand, hardcore gamers take playing video games very seriously. According to the article, they should &#8220;spend as<br />
much time as possible, play as difficult games as possible, play games at<br />
the expense of everything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are the typical stereotypes of casual and hardcore gamers, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../files/2012/03/LEGO_Star_Wars_Video_Game.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-709" src="../../../../files/2012/03/LEGO_Star_Wars_Video_Game.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>An example that comes to mind for casual video games is <em>Lego Star Wars</em> for the Nintendo Wii. In the game itself, it has an emotionally positive element to it. The low graphics and fun storyline make it enjoyable for all ages. There are multiple instances in the game where characters fall down, play jokes on each other, and bump into doors, which adds to the less-serious atmosphere of the game. The game is also easy to learn how to play within a few minutes on the Wii. There are only four main components that a user needs to know to complete the game: jump, attack, toggle characters, and use items. Juiciness of the game includes getting over 1 million coins, completing objectives, and unlocking new content. The interruptibility of the game lags, however, as the user must reach a checkpoint before they can save. However, the straightforwardness of the game allows the user to reach checkpoints relatively easily. Finally, the punishments in the game are very low. A user starts out with four hearts, and each hit by an opponent eliminates one of these hearts. When all four hearts are depleted, the user is destroyed, but the game still continues (though you lose all your coins). So basically there is no possible way to lose the game.</p>

Davis refuted this argument, and was mostly right in saying that the music industry would not be hurt by video games, but he was wrong in his title, as three years later, &#8220;Super Mario Bros&#8217;&#8221; was released and made history with its iconic music and sounds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vastdifference.com/nintendo/nsf/research/Video%20game%20music_%20not%20just%20kid%20stuff.pdf">http://www.vastdifference.com/nintendo/nsf/research/Video%20game%20music_%20not%20just%20kid%20stuff.pdf</a></p>
<p>The paper above was written by a Yale student in 1999, and includes many interesting facts about the rise of video games and their music. Written around the time in which &#8220;Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time&#8221; was released (1998), the paper offers an interesting point of view during the time of the first solid video game scores.</p>
<p>In present day, some video game scores can be as involved as movie scores, but have they crossed the gap and become &#8220;stand alone&#8221; music, capable of competing in the music industry? Many movies release their soundtracks, and generate large amounts of profit from it, could video games start doing this in a big way? Blizzard is already starting to release soundtracks for their games, and the Halo franchise has generated a lot of buzz, the soundtrack for Halo 3 is the highest grossing video game soundtrack on Itunes.</p>

It got me thinking about one thing though… Is the music part of the game, or are game just part of the music. I know that’s poorly worded so I will elaborate. Game music has changed over the years from the bleeps and bloops of Pong to the wonderful rich scores of games like Halo and Oblivion. But also music in general has changed a lot in its respective history, from renaissance to classical and romantic to modern.  So is this change we are seeing in game music, is it coming from changes in games in general or from changes in music or both? Game music is not quite like the soundtrack to a movie or a new album released by a musical artist, it has its own methods, purposes, and functions. So I think what I am trying to say is: Is the development of game music as a medium a change more in the realm of gaming or in the realm of music?</p>

Most prominent is the advancement of the technology that delivers sound to the player of the videogame. This advancement is affected by a variety of issues. Sound generation has been a limiter for games in the past, as the sounds were created on the console itself. A transition occurred towards recorded sounds due to the limitations of sound generating technology. Once recorded sounds were being used, the issue of memory space was once again limiting the game. As speaker technology advanced, the use of surround sound increased. All of these factors remain dependent on one another. Speaker technology, a force outside of the realm of the videogame or the console, determined what sounds would be incorporated into the game. The memory of the game disk then determined what sounds would be included, while the limitation of the consoles processing power determined how many sounds could be played at once. What could be different?</p>
<p>Role Playing (video)Games represent a new spectrum of sound development for videogames. The realistic elements of some RPG’s require realistic sounds, aside from the unrealistic, aesthetically focused, sounds associated with other videogames. Sounds began to focus on these realistic elements, and they continued to develop in that spectrum. Is it possible that a new area of sound emerge? With a new game, console, or development of speakers, I feel that the sounds present in videogames could transform again. This wouldn’t need to affect all videogames; it could only develop for a limited focus. But what would that new focus be?</p>
<p>I challenge everyone to think about a new sound presence.</p>

One of the most interesting observations that was made in the article comes from an experiment where there were two objects trying to escape another object. There were two different soundtracks played in the background with two different groups of participants. The participants were asked which character they thought was more active. In both of the different soundtracks the participants found that the character in which the music matched their actions was found to be more active. This led the experimenter to develop the &#8220;Congruence Associonist framework&#8221; in which it is determined that music, in a game or video, can cause the viewer to make visual associations in that media. This is a very interesting concept on how our brain interprets and combines audio and visual signals, and how they both play a role in influencing one another.</p>

Some of us appreciate being able to buy tracks on iTunes instead of having to buy CDs, while others enjoy downloading music without paying anything. Since it&#8217;s very unlikely that in the 21st century, at your young age, you prefer CDs, I&#8217;ll just assume that all of us belong to one of the above 2 categories, and thus we are very happy with the MP3 format. However, most artists and production companies probably wish the MP3 format (or any other compression before it) was never created, because it allows for illegal distribution of music, and therefore it reduces their profit. It was very interesting to find out that gaming companies were (and still are) in favor of MP3. That is because it allows their platforms to play more and better audio effects with the limited amount of RAM they have. So not just greedy consumers want MP3s to stick around&#8230;<br />
2) In this chapter, Collins mentions that games drive the technologies in the area of sound. I think I agree with this. If it was up to the music production companies, the development of audio quality would have probably ended with the CDs/DVDs. They deliver great quality to the users and great profit to the producers. The gaming industry introduced the need for great quality and small size of audio files, and continues to look for ways to improve the already realistic, interactive, 3D sound effects of their games.</p>

The role of the movie playing device, formerly filled by DVD players and the like, has been encroached on by game consoles such as the PS3 and Xbox 360. Movie services such as hulu and netflix have also become available through game consoles, further solidifying their roles as general purpose entertainment devices. Game consoles are essentially very specialized computers built just to play games, but as their functions become broader, I believe they will become more and more like regular computers. Simplified web browsers would not be surprising to see, and consoles have offered keyboards in the past so there is no reason they would not be made to allow easier browsing as well.</p>
<p>However, whereas you can upgrade or build a PC yourself, consoles must be bought from the company and not tinkered with at all. Currently console makers do not like people messing with their machines in any way, and I think that trend will continue. By not allowing modifications they make sure that customers will have to buy their next product instead of just having to upgrade certain parts. Also, with consoles there is an ease of access that does not always come with PCs; there is no worrying over parts or specifications to make sure a game runs well. I think that as different platforms become more able to perform others&#8217; roles and lines blur between them, this will become one of the more important distinctions between consoles and computers.</p>

I am astounded not by the statistics presented necessarily, but by how other-worldliness the description of places like Foxconn seem . It seems as if Foxconn has created a world like that described in George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>. The workers go on working meticulously for hours on end with minimal rest or compensation. At first, I could not believe that one of the world’s most prestigious companies allows such unfairness to continue. I actually heard about the conditions of the makers of the popular iPhone about a week ago before reading this article. However, now that I have read about the specific conditions of the workers and heard hard statistics about the deaths of the employees, the distant story now takes on an uncomfortable proximity.</p>
<p>Now I agree that we should take on learning about the history of games and of other technology we use on a day to day basis because doing so makes us not only better informed consumers, but also better informed people. However, if we take on this mentality of gathering as much information as possible regarding the history of our games and technology why not take on the same mentality regarding our automobiles, our furniture, our stationery and our clothing? It is borderline impossible and may be even unreasonable to expect to educate oneself on all of one’s purchases even though doing so would probably result in more fair trade practices as well as better conditions for others.  The more reasonable approach I believe is to educate those workers who are exploited and to make an example of companies engaged such practices by taking their business down through legislation and lawsuits.</p>

I am astounded not by the statistics presented necessarily, but by how other-worldliness the description of places like Foxconn seem . It seems as if Foxconn has created a world like that described in George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>. The workers go on working meticulously for hours on end with minimal rest or compensation. At first, I could not believe that one of the world’s most prestigious companies allows such unfairness to continue. I actually heard about the conditions of the makers of the popular iPhone about a week ago before reading this article. However, now that I have read about the specific conditions of the workers and heard hard statistics about the deaths of the employees, the distant story now takes on an uncomfortable proximity.</p>
<p>Now I agree that we should take on learning about the history of games and of other technology we use on a day to day basis because doing so makes us not only better informed consumers, but also better informed people. However, if we take on this mentality of gathering as much information as possible regarding the history of our games and technology why not take on the same mentality regarding our automobiles, our furniture, our stationery and our clothing? It is borderline impossible and may be even unreasonable to expect to educate oneself on all of one’s purchases even though doing so would probably result in more fair trade practices as well as better conditions for others.  The more reasonable approach I believe is to educate those workers who are exploited and to make an example of companies engaged such practices by taking their business down through legislation and lawsuits.</p>

By buying the product are we supporting the 12-16 hour shifts and making the quota higher? I believe its safe to say that most of the consumers of our most used electronics really haven&#8217;t thought about where their favorite gadget comes from or how it&#8217;s made so any article like Joel Johnson&#8217;s (<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/02/ff_joelinchina/all/1">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/02/ff_joelinchina/all/1</a>) is a good one. Awareness is a good thing- but now that more and more of the public is finding out about how their xbox is made there needs to be a culture change. I don&#8217;t think many people are going to stop buying the latest electronic product and I think that it&#8217;s silly to think that giant companies aren&#8217;t going to exploit workers in other countries. But how much responsibility should the average consumer take? At least enough to get informed about where our stuff comes from and enough to be able to inform others. The more people that know about our iphones&#8217; origins equals more people that will want to do something about it- maybe pay more for the same product that we know was made by happy, reasonably  worked and payed employees. If we all spread even the basic knowledge that the people making our gadgets are overworked and that it shouldn&#8217;t be that way- we&#8217;re on our way to a better future- and we individually shouldn&#8217;t feel all that bad.</p>

Joel Johnson asks us to think about how much we, as consumers, are to blame for some of the horrid working conditions which plague factories that manufacture the very gadgets that have become an essential part of our daily lives.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that working conditions in some of these factories are questionable. Yet, must we feel so much guilt about it?  Can we not take two steps without being put on a guilt trip by someone who lectures us about the conditions in which our devices are made, typing from the very computer or tablet he or she criticizes others for using?  This is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Did you know that western countries are not the only countries that use smart-phones, high-end electronics, and computers? In fact, the Asian market–where many of these products originate–is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world, with a rapidly-growing consumer base.  The idea that western consumption–specifically American consumption–is the only thing that drives the massive manufacturing sector in countries like China and Thailand is unfounded.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Economic Times </em>(a publication of the <em>India Times</em>) as of August 30, 2011, the number of mobile phone users in China alone stood at 929 million people. That&#8217;s nearly <em>three times </em>the population of the United States alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See it here:</p>
<p>http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-08-30/news/29945263_1_phone-users-number-of-cell-phone-mobile-phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addressing the aspect of worker suicides, it is right that Foxconn should be concerned about them. Yet, given the relatively low number of suicides among employees, there may be a host of other factors involved that may not necessarily have to do with working conditions. Worker suicides should not be used as a starting point for discussions on working conditions – <em>working conditions </em>should be used as a starting point for discussion.</p>
<p>What do we make of this information? Should we be concerned about working conditions in these factories? Of course we should be concerned, but the idea that we should harbor some form of first-world guilt over employee suicides is silly, especially since our consumption dollars are giving people jobs that provides housing and food in a job market where many alternatives are worse. Attempting to put western consumers on a guilt trip and blaming western consumption for employee suicides is not the way to start a discussion as serious as this.</p>
