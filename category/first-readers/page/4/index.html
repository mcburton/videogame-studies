<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must say that the <em>Wired </em>article, while informative, was done in really rather poor taste. Seventeen suicides&#8230; seventeen&#8230; purportedly out of 1 million employees&#8230; and that rate is a driving force for the article? National suicide rates are generally recorded as # per 100k population per year, so if we take the &#8220;spate of nine between March and May 2010,&#8221; (which I assume is the highest isolated rate) we end up with&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[9/(1 Million)] * [1yr/(3mon) ] * 100000 = 3.6 yearly suicides per 100k workers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Some Wikipedia hunting reveals that as of 2010, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn">Foxconn</a> has an estimated 920,000+ employees, with 2010 bearing witness to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides#2010">estimated</a> 18 attempted suicides with 14 deaths. This is a yearly attempt rate of ~1.96 per 100,000.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The yearly suicide rate in China is somewhat debated, but the 2010 value estimated by the Center for Disease Control/Prevention is 22.3 per 100,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, during the three months of the highest suicide rate at Foxconn, the rate was only ~16% the national average in China. Although the Foxconn Suicides page linked above mentions that the Foxconn rate is likely lower in part because of lesser suicide rates for the younger adults that would make up the employee demographic, an 85% discrepancy from national average is something I&#8217;m more than comfortable with.</p>
<p>The rate of 1.96 in 2010 raises this gap to slightly over 91%. That is, Foxconn workers committed suicide at 91% lower rate per capita than other Chinese citizens.</p>
<p>So no, even though I may be willing to feel sorry for those in a more demanding and limited economic situation in general, I will not feel bad for buying hardware just because it was made in a factory. In fact, I&#8217;ll feel good about it; a little bit of the money I spend on that hardware allows someone to be employed at an admittedly horrible assembly job while their other options may only be worse.</p>
<p>So is this article enlightening about modern factory conditions at a multibillion dollar manufacturing company? Yes. Should attention be given to working conditions in nations with little worker protection and a large market for tedious manufacturing jobs? Of course. Are the suicides at Foxconn something that should be at the forefront of this attention? Not at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

The phrase is an idiom about how something can be so easily dismissed if it is not in direct view. This idiom is brought up in modern times because of a little place in China called Shenzhen.</p>
<p>I never really thought, nor cared, about the original origins of my many electronics. I always had the fantastic dream of little robots carefully crafting, ever so precise and diligently, the very laptop, phone and iPods in my possession. My dream was not ruined until recently thanks to a short segment on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Stewart used his comedic charm to shed a light, while a humorous one, on a very serious topic. I was fully surprised by the report. I typically thought manufacturing plants for electronics were housed with numerous robots. I also thought sweat shops were located in the tropical Pacific in old, ruined wooden shacks. I never realized I could imagine something so completely wrong. After a few quick glimpses of their living arrangements, I believed that they were being treated very well. A beautiful neon city with better-than-expected living styles. Then I heard the details. Twelve hour shifts. Non-existent breaks. Constant work days. Hopelessness. Suicides. I was appalled that such things could happen. Even now, revisiting the subject and listening to the shocking details, I am still engrossed as to how this could happen.</p>
<p>Then I remembered, &#8220;ignorance is bliss&#8221;. I never cared about where things came from as long as I could have it. All I wanted is the new iPod or the new gaming console, not thinking of the consequences. A sick feeling comes over me at the idea that some part of this tragedy is partly my fault. Even if it is a little bit. I think the worst part is I will forget this and continue the vicious cycle of consumer goods. Hopefully, I can be like the character at the end of Five Key&#8217;s song in which Rudy West sings,</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Out of sight, but not out of my mind</em>.&#8221;</p>

This, it is explained, is why <em>Ping</em>-<em>Pong</em> was more successful than <em>Computer Space- </em>because Ping-Pong, as a tabletop game, was a familiar pastime with the general population and the more futuristic space theme was completely new. I think the popularity of these &#8220;rear-view mirror&#8221; games is still prominent today. The Wii practically banked on it. The system itself came initially packaged with <em>Wii Sports</em>, a hugely popular game in which you played casual sports through the Wii&#8217;s interactive interface with the motion sensitive &#8220;Wii-mote&#8221; and nunchuk. Sticking with the familiarity of these casual sports, the <em>Wii Sports </em>was able to reach a much bigger audience, focusing on families as consumers and not simply the serious gamers. Had they packaged the Wii with another game, say, a new, innovative puzzle game that made similar use of their motion sensitive and infrared technology, it is highly likely that they would have polarized their target consumers. Even if a shooter had been packaged with it, not all &#8220;non-gamers&#8221; can identify with that. They made an incredibly smart move with that and, coupled with the emergence of casual games on smart phones, have moved the market into casual gaming and greatly expanded their reach in terms of consumers; now anybody can be a gamer. The Xbox Kinect and Playstation Move followed suit, trying to appeal to larger demographics. What does this mean for &#8220;serious&#8221; platformers, though? Will we see a lull in their production? Will we see more and more casual games, more available and familiar to us, until we get tired of them and usher in a second era of ground-breaking platform games? We&#8217;re at a very interesting point in game history right now, and it will be interesting to see how things unfold in the future.</p>

<p>Certainly, the article makes its point. If Spacewar! is your thing, Spacewar can provide reams of entertainment which may or may not be matchable by modern machines. Spacewar can be found here: http://spacewar.oversigma.com/ and is a two-player game. You can&#8217;t honestly play it by yourself. Still, I can imagine playing spacewar and dealing with the black hole (not present in the original version, added to increase the difficulty) and your opponent providing quite a large chunk of fun, as you and your opponent attempt to outwit and outgun.</p>
<p>A game which I remember coming installed on older computers for some reason is Battlezone, which Atari helpfully maintains a copy of on their website (more advanced than the one I recall playing as a child) here: http://atari.com/arcade/arcade/battlezone As the article suggests, Battlezone was a serious innovation, giving the concept of videogames as more than entertainment, and also demonstrating their actual capacities to the market (even if skirting its actual technological abilities using procedural generation and vector graphics).</p>
<p>You can easily google your favorite copy of Pac-Man, being a ubiquitous game, but it uses a few things which suggest that innovation has indeed helped the industry. Spacewar can be a frustratingly limiting game. It&#8217;s a game with no margin for error, you either shoot your foe or they shoot you, and that will be the end of things, and what&#8217;s more it has to be restarted when a player is victorious, as the game has no provision for multiple matches or lives or score-keeping, which are all elements handleable by the player, but something in this day and age we *expect* from a game.</p>
<p>Getting back to the article&#8217;s point, the gloom-and-doom concept of the video game market crashing is best described as plausible. It could happen again, we can see how it can happen again, and every day you can go to a gaming news site and find yourself some equally stormy prediction about how Call of Duty is Ruining Videogames (http://www.gamejudgment.com/how-call-of-duty-is-ruining-gaming#more-6064). </p>
<p>A lot of discussion amongst myself and my friends, being gamers of different stripes, myself an Xbox360-PC gamer, a friend PS3-360 and a former Gamestop employee, another exclusively PC, and yet another PS3 and handhelds, each of us bringing different arguments to the table, and different evidence, have come to the conclusion that the success or failure of videogames hinges on the WiiU in this upcoming cycle. Evidence for this is of course circumspect, it&#8217;s not as if we went out and properly researched this, but it is a real concern amongst gamers right now, though whether it is with just cause remains to be seen.</p>
<p>A last side note on this: It reminds me of people who compare Rome and America with the intent that &#8220;as Rome fell, so too shall America&#8221; somehow neglecting that the odds of survival for any nation are statistically low, and infinite duration isn&#8217;t plottable.</p>

As an economics major, sometimes I find myself comparing things I read to my major. This definitely happened during the subsection “Meltdown”. In 1982 home sales of video games were about three billion dollars, and the arcade game business was about eight billion dollars. Video game sales were extremely successful in the 1980s, but what happened? Why did this industry become reduced to a “little more than an economic crater”? Well, a basic microeconomic supply and demand graph can solve that question. The video game market was a relatively new in the 80s. As demand rose for these markets, the suppliers could not predict the large growth rate. With the possibility of making positive economic profits, many different companies entered the video game market. As stated in the text, most of these new companies had nothing innovative to offer and game revenues still fell, pushing the least effective companies out of business. It took time but the supply eventually reached the equilibrium for video games. Today there are many game companies that are effective. These are the companies that offer new and innovative games that consumers want to play with technology that does not fail. With such a fast growing market, one cannot expect the supply to match the demand at first, but the market will eventually compensate for the increase in demand to reach an equilibrium with supply.</p>

These games were first developed by the hackers who were exploring the possibilities of Computer capabilities at the time. With thoughts going back to our first week of class on what is fun, I found myself wondering what is was about these very basic first computer games that people found fun? Was it in physically interacting with the device? Was it seeing an output from the device respond to the players input? Was it in seeing the visual display of the computer to create various images? I do not think so, because these initial ‘game developers’ had put in so much time and work with these machines that they knew many of their capabilities and would not be entertained by the same old thing they had seen before. I believe their entertainment came from the thematic tone created by the combination of all of the computer aspects coming together to be called a game. It was the sense of doing something other than math and calculations with a computer. It was not the shapes that made up the space ships or lasers, or the input buttons that caused the game to be fun; but the sense that you were playing a game. I believe it was the sense that you are shooting space ship, aliens, or asteroids; the sort of story or template placed over the non-diegetic computer processes that entertained the players of these first video games. Even now in the present I feel it is the sense of play created by a game itself, which makes it a game.</p>

I do not play a lot of video games but I have participated in some discussions centered on video games. The most popular of them all seems to be the question of violent video games and their effects on the human player. Now, I have heard different arguments for both sides, both from my peers and different professors, yet, I have never heard any sort of point made in regards to the origins of video games. I find it highly interesting that the root of video games was within our military agency. I also found it interesting that the first hackers could be considered as video game explorers. With these two concepts it seems that the argument that gives them a negative connotation is that the skills or characteristics of violent video games and hackers were taken too far. When and why did people get uncomfortable with either issue? What’s the goal of a hacker today? Are they still participating in the whimsical activity of divergent thinking? If not, has it been replaced with another goal or vice? These are just some of the questions that I thought about early on in the chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In playing <em>Asteroids</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em> I also began to think about the diegetic element of scenery in which games are placed.  The chapter discussed the importance of the Sci-fi genre and its solidification of a prime youth genre with the release of the Star Wars movie. But I wonder if games like <em>Asteroids</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em>, that I assume mimic the early games like <em>Spacewars </em>or <em>Battlezone</em>, were not set in Space but on Earth with people instead of aliens and a cop car instead of a spaceship, would the issue of video game violence been raised sooner? Even though, if violence is the main concern, one might expect the violent act of shooting aliens to be one of uproar as well early on in the video game world.</p>

In chapter one, Galloway notes that cheats and hacks are often built into games, yet they are discouraged by many as a way of taking shortcuts when others are playing according to the rules. But macros and add-ons are &#8220;tolerated, even encouraged.&#8221; (pg. 13) Galloway&#8217;s overall view regarding cheats, glitches, macros, and add-ons is that they shouldn&#8217;t necessarily be viewed as entirely hostile to the gaming experience, but rather should be viewed as <em>part of </em>the gaming experience. This topic, brought up as almost a side topic by one of the members of the presenting group devolved into a rather interesting argument regarding cheating.<br />
The traditional view is that all games should be played by the rules, video games not being an exception. However, there are those who argue that if a cheat code can be entered or a macro can be used that the developers intended that element be included in the game. Using that element would, in turn, not offend the developers&#8217; intentions for the game.</p>
<p>Perhaps, given the changing times and the changing &#8220;game landscape,&#8221; it is more appropriate for me to have an evolving, more progressive view on cheating in video games. Call me conservative if you will, but I feel as if cheating takes away from the intentions of the game (to play through each level fairly and eventually win) and can even put other, much less experienced players at a disadvantage. In many cases, the actions of  certain players, particularly in the realm of online, PC gaming, can be especially abhorrent. As former PC owner, I used to really enjoy playing Battlefield 2. Most of the time, players were honest, and servers would be quick to kick players whom they determined to be cheating, exploiting a glitch, or using a bot. Once, I would be on a server and there was a player who exploited every possible glitch, and use one part of the map as a portal to get to another part. This player was also able to exploit a glitch that allowed him or her to become invisible when standing in a particular alleyway, which would allow him or her to kill other players without detection. Players noticed this, and attempted to contact server admins for assistance in kicking the offending player. When no assistance was rendered, people began leaving the server and it stopped being fun to play on that map.</p>
<p>Although I get on my soapbox and rail against cheating, I admit that I have done it, particularly when I was the owner of an XBOX console. My reason for employing cheat codes was simple: I got stuck.<br />
This article from Forbes Magazine provides a great insight to the main reasons why people cheat and why, in some cases, it may be good for us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article takes an interesting look at User Interfaces in different games.  Similar to the Galloway reading, the author of this article (Marcus Andrews) uses a quartered categorization system for interfaces in games.  His two axes are that of diegetic and non-diegetic interfaces (exists in the game world or not) and 3D representation (is the interface viewed in 3D by the player, whether or not it is in the actual game world).  He takes a look at some specific games including Dead Space and Far Cry 2, examines which elements of the games show what type of interface, and points out the benefits and drawbacks of each.  This article provides a more specific look at the diegetic-nondiegetic conversation we had in class.</p>
