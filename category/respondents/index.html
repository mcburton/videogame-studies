<p>With an MMO, the designer also needs to think about the large amounts of players that will try to take on quests at the same time.  Problems, like large lines to get to an NPC or waiting for a dungeon to reset itself for the next group of players, can cause players to get frustrated.  Some solutions we looked at for this problem would be having a seperately generated dungeon appear for parties or having a large area that allows multiple player to help in a quest and all recieve some sort of reward.</p>

<p>The most important points of his presentation were his sources of inspiration and strategies for fostering creative and imaginative growth.  He spent time discussing the importance of passion.  The video game industry is tough and competitive. Passion is sustaining and vital, and it is the key ingredient to success, especially to survive the game industry.  It is what will get you up in the morning, and get you through the hard times when inspiration may be low.</p>
<p>When discussing sources of inspiration, Cox said, &#8220;What made your eyes light up as a child still has the power now&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; This quote really stood out to me during the session.  From his presentation, it seemed that most of his inspiration derived from childhood enjoyments and current forms of entertainment such as movies, books, and other video games.  People often forget what it takes to inspire them, but the answer is as simple as looking back into your childhood.  When he mentioned this point, this simple exercise brought me back to the sources of my inspiration, which is something that I have not thought about it a long time.</p>
<p>He brought up some very important points about inspiration within a professional setting.  Collaboration is essential to work in the video game industry.  However, a good strategy to employ is establishing &#8220;circles of trust.&#8221;  These circles are creative and inspirational outlets with trustworthy and supportive people inside and out of the professional environment.  Having &#8220;circles of trust&#8221; enables you to share your passion with other people in a constructive manner.  I thought this was a very valuable and worthwhile strategy for a long term career in the gaming industry or other inspiration-based industries.</p>

Ken gave a very quick but detailed presentation on what tools are useful for a narrative game designer. Some points that particularly stood out to me were the ideas of tactibility and a player’s emotional response to a game.</p>
<p>The topic of tactibility came up when discussing the importance of the quality of objects one uses in a narrative game. Narrative games are dense in their use of dialogue. Objects intentionally placed to interact with characters can give the player information in a more interactive or tactile way. An example of this was a worn train ticket. Rolston showed this image in his presentation and it sparked my interest. I wondered what are some things that a train ticket could say better than a dialogue among characters or the narrator and the player. A train ticket could tell the player, where they’re going or have been, or where some one else in the story has been or is going. What are other objects that can speak for themselves? Would an engraved ring or a planner do the same?</p>
<p>A connection I did not expect to make with narrative games is their attentiveness to the player’s emotional experience. Take the train ticket for example, what if the train ticket revealed that a loved one in the story planned to escape or runaway. This would most likely evoke a sense of sadness or anger due to betrayal; nonetheless the tactile object evoked a emotional response. Similarly Rolston discussed that fonts evoke different emotions as well. Fonts can take the player into a different time period and then evoke a sense of emotion through different perceptions. I found this idea to parallel our past discussion in regards to how music in games evoke an emotional response. I think fonts evoking a sense of emotion in a player is an idea we do not consciously notice but is a very powerful one. The emotions a font stirs up are not only valuable in narrative games but have value in other games as it could potentially sustain the mood of a game even while the player navigates menus or opening scenes. Are there other non-diegetic elements that purposefully evoke a subconscious emotional response from the player?</p>

This included anything from the Challenger disaster to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. It was argued many times that older events that occurred before our lifetimes would feel more comfortable if a videogame was made about them. I do not think this is entirely true. I believe that it mainly depends on which disastrous events in history are emphasized to be the most sensitive. These events can be different for any given person.</p>
<p>There has been wide public backlash faced by games such as <em>JFK: Reloaded</em>. But games like Call of Duty that allow players to fight as terrorists and kill Americans do not receive that sort of backlash. Therefore, I do not think historical relevance has that much to do with controversy generated by videogames made about sensitive events. Subjects of all kinds will continue to be presented in videogames. I do not think any sort of line can really be drawn as something that takes things too far. Because they are games, people do not have to actually play them. Just like books and movies, people have a choice as to what they want to expose themselves to. I predict that even more games about events like these will be made in the future.</p>

<p>Which is to say, because videogames can simulate, this is what they should be used for. This If A, Then B mindset is sort of limiting.</p>
<p>It makes sense on the face &#8211; videogames are a distinct medium, and as with any medium it should play to its strengths, right? Well, really, sometimes you don&#8217;t play to a medium&#8217;s strengths for a few different reasons. Firstly, maybe you aren&#8217;t good with any other medium. Secondly, perhaps you wish to make a point of using an off-medium. Thirdly, it ultimately doesn&#8217;t matter as long as it works.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, videogames *are* a bit of an odd medium, in that they can include other mediums inside them, due to the miracle of turing complete programming. Videogames have even been known to have other videogames inside them. What&#8217;s more, because of this flexibility, frequently the medium is used in a manner which makes it resemble other mediums. Cutscenes are like short films, text adventures are interactive notvels, etc.</p>
<p>So ultimately I felt it weird that videogames should be treated as just limited to this simulation thing, when they can and will do more than that.</p>

The major differences discussed in class were between how games and books raised social and political awareness. Whereas books tell a narrative to identify with a character, games use experiential simulation to give the same effect.</p>
<p>I disagree that story traits and game traits are separate. Rather games use a blend of story traits and game traits to help raise awareness. Because of games ability to tell a story experientially they are capable of teaching history. But as Joseph wrote, “one must be careful with such an approach when it comes to learning about history.” That is because although games are capable of teaching history, fallacious games would do more harm than good. As we saw from the JFK game, the FBI reports score sheet rated no shots higher than missed shots. If altering the past in a video game is acceptable then it does not accurately portray historical events.</p>
<p>If players could kill or save a historical figure in a video game, similar to the JFK game, then it would change the alternate reality based on the player’s performance. I agree that this would “trivialize the value of human life”. From reading historical events we can learn particular sets of values that would be lost in an experiential video game. This sums up the idea that videogames have the potential to raise global awareness for social and political issues but has not come to the point of creating social change.</p>

<div></div>
<p style="margin-top: 10px">In class yesterday, we discussed games that portray historical events, such as the JFK shooting. Video games like <em>JFK Reloaded</em> accurately portray an event in the recent past. Because we are put in Lee Harvey Oswald&#8217;s shoes in the video game, we have the ability to reenact his actions on that fateful day. We can point the gun, look down the sight, and choose where and when to fire. This is different than if we watched a documentary on the JFK shooting, even if we viewed it from the perspective of Oswald.</p>
<p>Compare this to the movie <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, which we saw in class back in February. The most climatic moment of the movie is when Buffalo Bill stalks Clarice Starling. The camera terrifyingly switches to the serial killer&#8217;s view with his night goggles on. This puts us in the shoes of a cold-blooded killer. We don&#8217;t have control of the killer as we do in <em>JFK Reloaded</em>. He cocks his revolver and swipes in an attempt to grab Starling on his own.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, do we still feel like we are somehow responsible for the attempted death of Starling? We were not directly involved in her attempted murder, but the movie still produces the effect of putting us inside the mind of a serial killer. In this way, it accomplishes the same goal as <em>JFK Reloaded</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we feel like we&#8217;re in a first-person shooter in the movie. We can see Buffalo Bill&#8217;s hands and the gun in his hand. If a video game was made of <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, in which we played Buffalo Bill, what would the goal of the game be? For Starling to kill us or to successfully murder the rookie FBI agent? Would we be accurately portraying the movie (as it exists in history) if we allowed Sterling to kill Buffalo Bill?</p>
<p>I argue that for this to be a playable and successful video game, it would need to model <em>Flight to Freedom</em>. Different choices would be made available to the player (Buffalo Bill) throughout the game, but the final outcome would be the same. In this case, it would be death. But as in <em>Flight to Freedom</em>, badges, trust, and items could be acquired that could alter the storyline of the game. However, to be faithful to the movie and its writers, the inevitable end would not change.</p>

<p>Tuesdays class left many of us discussing the concept of Kitsch in relation to videogames. I was pretty puzzled when reading this portion of the text, wondering if this was truly a category worthy of being a chapter. My group posed the question; Can hardware be classified as Kitsch?</p>
<p>Kitsch is classified as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Art, objects, or design considered to be in poor taste because of excessive garishness or sentimentality, but sometimes appreciated in an ironic or knowing way. The lava lamp is an example of sixties kitsch</li>
<li>Excessively garish or sentimental art; usually considered in bad taste</li>
<li>Kitsch is a form of <a title="Visual art" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_art">art</a> that is considered an inferior, <a title="Taste (sociology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_(sociology)">tasteless</a> copy of an extant style of art or a worthless imitation of art of recognized value</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe I have found the answer to that question.</p>
<p>There have been a variety of game hardware systems that I would consider being Kitsch. I remember seeing a game console when I was younger that looked like a Nintendo 64 controller but was a whole system that connected to the television. This system contained a variety of games. While I could not track this down, this concept of other game systems that are counterfeit can be seen here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smosh.com/smosh-pit/photos/16-ridiculous-knock-game-consoles">http://www.smosh.com/smosh-pit/photos/16-ridiculous-knock-game-consoles</a></p>
<p>Whether it be the black market game console, or a multipack of technically legal but cheaply reproduced Tetris and such games, I feel that these concepts and consoles are Kitsch. This hardware would fall under the classification of imitation and inferior.</p>

However, I think that in some ways more hardcore games can be relaxing as well. For example, Team Fortress 2 is a game that I would consider as more of a hardcore sort of game rather than casual, though it has some aspects of casual games such as interruptibility. When I play Team Fortress 2, most of the time it is pretty laidback and relaxing. Once I find a nice server to play on I can zone out and play for hours without realizing it. I also think that games like Dark Souls can be relaxing as well, despite the difficulty of the game. Dying and having to run the same gauntlet again can become methodical and second nature, and I think with more experience in the game it becomes easier to play in a relaxed state. I always just take my deaths in stride, since anything lost in death can be regained, so it is not as stressful as as it seems like it could be at first.</p>
<p>Of course it is also possible to become frustrated in either of these games due to not making progress after repeated attempts, but that is also possible in more casual games as well. I think the key difference is that hardcore games are often harder than casual games, so the player needs to be in the right mindset to be able to relax with hardcore games. If the player is not one to get frustrated with failure then I believe that hardcore games are viable sources of relaxation.</p>

In the beginning of this semester, we learned about how almost all games (not just the electronic ones) involve <em>pretending</em> to a certain extent. It&#8217;s what makes games enjoyable, whether it&#8217;s a kid running around the house and pretending to be a superhero, or one of us pretending to be in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. At the end of her post, Vianney asks if a common hardcore game could be altered into a casual one and, if so, what elements would need to change. I believe that in order to achieve such a transformation, the elements of a hardcore game that would need to be changed (or even removed) are exactly the <em>texture</em> and <em>participation.</em> The texture could be changed by replacing the visual details with simple, cartoon-like images, and the sound effects by a playful background melody. The participation could be changed by making it difficult for the player to pretend to be the main character. One way this could be done is by making a 1st person game into a 3rd person one. If you don&#8217;t believe that a hardcore game can be made into a casual game, you should play the Flash version of Portal.</p>

Many students have said that art &#8220;lacks a definition&#8221; and have &#8220;undefined boundaries&#8221;. But to what point does art stop being art in video games? I understand that hardcore games have artistic sense to them as well as some casual games, but what about simplistic games? Many argued that there is art in all games but I have to disagree. I feel that at some point games are no longer art. Tetris is an example of my opinion on art. The game is simply stacking blocks in a confined area. I feel no emotion or wonder when I play Tetris. The same goes for computer games like Solitaire and Minesweeper. Those games possess no real defining contributions to art.</p>
<p>A game came out recently for Playstation 3 users over the server called Journey. The game is about a silent protagonist that travels on a pilgrimage in the desert to discover themselves. The game radiates beauty and inspires thoughts and feelings. Many players, including yours truly, were deeply moved by the artistic feel of the game. Feelings of wonder and loneliness are felt when traversing across the barren, yet vivid landscape. This game is truly art. So I agree with Roger Ebert in the sense that art inspires feelings, including sadness. So while games like Journey or Limbo are art, games like Hearts and Backgammon are not because of the lack of emotional depth. Unless you cry bitter tears because of a bad click in Minesweeper.</p>

In the reading and in the In-Class Hosts&#8217; presentations, the issue of whether or not video games are a form of art came up. I would like to take the time to agree with Brett Baker that contemporary society will soon come to accept video games as a form of art. Additionally, I found it useful that Brett used the analogies of impressionism and jazz to justify his opinion. Indeed, as computer-based art programs (such as Adobe PhotoShop) grow in demand, and as computer graphic design becomes increasingly important in the marketing and art worlds, it seems only logical that video games will soon follow suit. Also, video games will fit well into the evolving category of modern art that places an emphasis on interaction. Interactive art is an increasingly popular subgenre of modern art, and has been very successful among art consumers worldwide. The evolution of interactive art began with the Dada movement in the 1920s and gradually progressed to include a wider consumer base and greater use of technology. One such example is <em>Wooden Mirrors</em>, which uses cameras, a computer, and overhead lighting to reproduce an image on wooden pixels. The exhibit, currently at The Open University in the United Kingdom, requires that a subject stand in front of the &#8220;mirror&#8221; while their movements are captured by cameras and reproduced by the wooden pixels in real time. Going back to video games, once the technology has improved and the current generation of &#8220;digital natives&#8221; grows up, it is my opinion that video games will become a widely accepted form of interactive art, in which consumers will play an even greater role than they do today. Evolution is inevitable.</p>

We then started talking about the differences between casual and hardcore games, and gamers. We often identified hardcore games usually as console or PC games that really immerse the player for hours at a time, and require a lot more time being put into it. We labeled casual games as more interrupt-able and less time consuming. This emphasis on time got me thinking. Sure you may only play Bubble Spinner, Tetris, or Angry Birds for a few minutes at a time, but often you play them more than once throughout the day and more often on a daily basis than hardcore games. If someone plays 10 minutes of a game on their smart phone 5 times a day every day that&#8217;s 6 hours a week ( if my math is right). I feel that if you played 6 hours of Angry Birds a week, that would make you a hardcore Angry Bird-er. So what I&#8217;m trying to get at is perhaps we should look differently at the element of time of game play when considering a game or gamer a hardcore or casual game. If you put the same amount of time into a *casual* mobile phone game as someone does in a *hardcore* game in  one week; perhaps you should reconsider your label as a casual gamer. </p>

The motivation, this First Reader claims, is to escape reality, and that can be applied to both casual and more hard core games. It&#8217;s the level, or, rather, entirety to which one wishes to escape the everyday that makes the difference between a casual gamer and a <em>gamer. </em>Someone looking for a quick distraction from the mundane might turn to a 5 minute game on his or her iPhone, whereas someone looking to escape into another reality altogether might turn to a more serious and time consuming game. Isn&#8217;t this escape from reality essentially the &#8220;Zone&#8221; we talked about later in class? Classmates talked a lot about getting &#8220;in the Zone&#8221; while playing a more serious game, one person expressing the feeling as being reached when you just become the controller, so to speak. I noticed that no one really spoke the same way about casual games where the flow can be broken and reassumed at will, because it is a distraction from reality. The level of immersion in the virtual reality of more serious games that classmates claimed to achieve while in the &#8220;Zone&#8221; definitely coincides with a fuller escape from reality that this First Reader connected, correctly, I think, with more serious games. We might be onto something there.</p>
<p>One other post by a First Reader that was brought up in class but not really discussed was the similarity in prices for casual and serious games for consoles. The point made was that casual games tend to have less appealing graphics and simpler mechanics when compared to more serious games, so why should they be priced the same? One thing I guess we haven&#8217;t discussed much (I&#8217;ll go off on a tangent here) is the replay value of a game. Take any of the more recent Final Fantasies, for example. You can log over a hundred hours on one game before you finish it, but once you&#8217;ve finished it, that&#8217;s it for most people. Making it to that hundred hours can be a challenge, too, especially if you take long breaks in between gameplay. Forgetting where you&#8217;re at and what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing when you finally return to it might lessen your motivation to continue the game. A casual console game, however, even though it may be played in short sessions, can rack up even more hours than that because it&#8217;s easy to pick up, easy to replay, and the gameplay is simple and relatively mindless. The hours my family has collectively gotten out of Wii Sports trumps those spent on my most favorite RPGs. Conclusively, in terms of how much entertainment you will get out of a game, casual and serious games are pretty competitive, so I think it&#8217;s reasonable that these games can be similarly priced.</p>
