Building off of the rear view mirror concept- there is nothing “new” to videogames. The perception of new is there, but that is not the reality. When asking the class: “have you performed a new motion on the Wii-mote?” The answer by all was “no”. The Wii was a wonderful innovation to the input aspect of the video game; however the software component remains the same- stuck in the confines of what is already in use (familiar). Video games have not broken the boundaries of new motion.</p>
<p>The input and software component go hand in hand. There needs to be a new type of video game requiring a new type of input. During the in class video, it was revealed that someone invented the joystick. This was invented to fly the spaceship with more precision than existing input devices. This can be seen as Guitar Hero set the foundation for the software side of a game requiring a new input device. At first it was applied to a guitar. Soon after, drums and other instruments were tapered into input devices for the existing software. The two are complimentary, and need to advance together.</p>
<p>When thinking of video games, I immediately think of home consoles. Arcades, however, possessed games with other forms of input. Dance Dance Revolution is an example of this. A beat pad for your feet is the primary input device. For fun, I suggest using a home console beat pad on other games. I used to jump around like a fool playing fighting games using the beat pad as the input device. It is fun… It is play.</p>

This will continue to stay this way because of what each genre sets out to accomplish. Games can not be narratives because of the original intent. Games are played with a goal in mind. When I play Oregon Trail or Tetris I have a specified goal in mind to accomplish. In Oregon Trail the goal is to get a group of people to a settlement in the West successfully. In Tetris the goal is to line up the blocks so they fit together.  Neither of these had in mind a goal of developing a plot nor does either of them need plot development in order to set this goal as the objective of the game. When I play Oregon Trail my goal is not to develop the characters in the game but rather to transport them. As Aarseth pointed out games are games and artistic elements are merely supports for the gameplay. Oregon Trail is still Oregon Trail without a narrative. Tetris is still tetris without a narrative. Games are measured on accomplishments. Narratives are not. The pursuit of an accomplishment figures into the identity of a game. There is pursuit of a goal every time one plays a game. Accomplishments, however, are not integral to the success or failure of a narrative or story. Because the intent of narratives and games are different the two genres will remain in their respective realms and attempts to merge the two will find little success.</p>

There are often cheats built into games for developers to go through them more easily to work on them. But is that the only time when cheat codes are okay? We brought up the idea in class that a video game reviewer gets a free pass, as cheats simplify the game they need to finish to write a review. Are there any other situations where cheating is okay? In my opinion, no. But the gaming community allows and even encourages macros and add-ons. I believe that macros are even worse than entering a cheat code to get more health or a giant head. One of the main points against cheating is that it wasn&#8217;t in the video game designer&#8217;s vision for how one completes the game. But at least with a cheat, you are still experiencing the diegetic part of the game, going to all the areas and performing all of the actions necessary to complete the game. Macro scripts automate player actions to automatically find items or defeat enemies for the player&#8217;s advantage. With macros, you don&#8217;t even have to play the part of the game that is finding items or fighting bad guys. Not only is it cheating on the same level as entering a code for health, but it takes away from the actual experience of playing. You mess up the artistic vision of the game designer even more because you aren&#8217;t even playing half the game! In my opinion macros should be tolerated as much or less than cheat codes in the gaming community.</p>

<p>One of the most passionate subjects mentioned during Tuesday&#8217;s lecture was that of cheating. Most students were able to express their distaste for cheating and for those who cheat; however, a definite explanation of the true meaning of the despicable action was not warranted. I believe this is because cheating has multiple meanings and variations.</p>
<p>First-reader MLAGANA touched on a sentiment I hold dear. Cheating is unfair and takes away from experience. An example of this is a glitch in the game <em>Skyrim. </em>In the game, there is a book that when used will grant the player +1 skill points in a certain field. The book if placed on a shelf, used again, but quickly discarded, allows the player to reuse the +1 skill point trick even though the original intention was an one use gift. I admit that after playing countless hours of the game I decided to use the glitch. To my astonishment, my character reached max level and dominated the rest of the game fairly easily. No sooner than after playing the game for two hours with my deity-like warrior, I stopped playing. Why? The game lost its luster. I no longer had an incentive to continue playing; thus, weakening my desire to play even more. By cheating, I was deprived of the expectation of a thrilling adventure. On the other hand, cheating has also allowed for careless fun and unfair advantages. The biggest example I can think of is any of the recent Grand Theft Auto games. I am hard press to find a person who did not use a cheat in the game. The idea of flying in an invincible helicopter, raining down fire in a faux New York City is tantalizing. I admit that the GTA games are only fun when used with the cheats. Do I feel any regrets for doing so? No, yet again, the main experience is gone although a new one is created.</p>
<p>I will reiterate again; I am not for cheating. I believe that hardships are meant to demoralize the player, but also to give them meaning and purpose to overcome. One of my favorite games in my childhood was <em>Ghosts N&#8217; Goblins. </em>The game was brutal to me as a kid , but I loved it. The difficulty enthralled me and passing a level gave me a whole new sense of accomplishment. While I myself will not use cheats for the majority of games, I do acknowledge they are there and accept them for what they are: an easy solution.</p>

Specifically, we skirted the question of whether a machine can become the operator of a game (henceforth referred to as &#8220;The Wonderfully Intrepid Question of Joyous Automation Loops,&#8221; or &#8220;TWIQJAL&#8221;†). I feel that it would be valid to posit that the answer to this question is all of yes, no, and somewhat; a definitive answer would depend on further clarification, such as the following.</p>
<p>Does the Operator &#8211; Machine relationship extend to game media other than video games?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px">If we posit that the operator machine relationship does not extend to other game media (i.e. interpersonal games not based on hardware or software programs), then the scope of situations in which an &#8220;Operator&#8221; exists, and thus the scope of situations in which TWIQJAL can be validly assessed, becomes fairly well-defined. This is the stance I am taking, as the Operator &#8211; Machine spectrum is introduced with video games in mind, and its scope was not intended to extend beyond such, as far as I can determine from the Galloway reading.</p>
<p>Must something be able to be considered &#8216;play&#8217; in order to be considered a game?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px">If a game‡ should be considered play, then it follows that TWIQJAL&#8217;s answer depends on whether a Machine can play. The answer to that, if we draw from Caillois&#8217; definition of play, is a resounding &#8220;almost, but no.&#8221; A machine programmed to play a game wouldn&#8217;t be expected to have the level of cognizance required for what most would consider a human level of &#8220;rational free will&#8221; in the matter. As such, the &#8220;game&#8221; is involuntary, and therefore not play based on Caillois&#8217; definition. I am of the viewpoint that a game must be considered play in some form to exist as a game; the entire purpose of games is to play them, and when stripped of this aspect of play, a game becomes nothing but an interactive system, no more of a &#8220;game&#8221; than any mundane electronic interface.</p>
<p>These are by no means the only questions that might be raised in assessing TWIQJAL, but the picture so far strongly favors the answer to be &#8220;no.&#8221; More specifically: &#8220;No, a machine cannot act as the Operator of a video game as presented by the Operator-Machine spectrum of analysis. A machine cannot engage in such activity in a willful manner such as is required for the activity to be considered &#8216;play&#8217; as Caillois defines it. Without the existence of play, the game ceases to be a game insofar as the applicability of the Operator-Machine relationship to it.&#8221; And they all lived happily ever after.</p>

<p>Why would someone continue to play a game that is not fun?  For me, &#8220;Upgrade Complete&#8221; was fun because I enjoyed the aspect of being able to improve the quality of the game throughout the game, but for someone else who would not care about the upgrades, the actual game probably would have been boring and too easy.  This game is a great beginning game to discuss because it causes some typical behavior of video game culture.  As Galloway says in the reading, &#8220;people move their hands, bodies, eyes, and mouths when they play video games&#8221; (4).  I noticed that same behavior from myself as I was playing, for example, leaning from side to side as my ship shot at the oncoming obstacles.  Another interesting parallel I noticed was the personification of the video game.  Galloway discusses how &#8220;video games are actions&#8221; (2).  They play and run.  The dialogue, especially in &#8220;Upgrade Complete&#8221; helps magnify this personification.</p>
