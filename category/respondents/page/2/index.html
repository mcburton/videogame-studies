Most of the people who spoke in class said that they felt disturbed or uncomfortable when playing this game. Why is this happening? Many of the students in Honors 353 play First Person Shooters with good graphics, and eventually end up killing hundreds or even thousands of people. What is the difference? Why should I feel so uncomfortable playing the Torture Game when the person actually looks like a rag doll and never once shouts out in pain or makes any indication of being alive? I believe it is the plot or back-story of the game. I recently have been playing <em>Splinter Cell: Conviction</em> for the PC until my computer decided it could not run it anymore. In the beginning of the game men are trying to kill the main character and through an act of self preservation the main character successfully kills many men and also proceeds to torture others for information. Why is this okay and the Torture Game can strike up such controversy? I think the reason is the Torture Game does not have a plot. There are not cut scenes and you have no idea who the characters are in the game.Â  The person being tortured is not defined as a terrorist or a dictator who has committed mass genocide on his people. I am curious if that change in the game would take away the unease people experience when they play the game? Could adding that element of possible moral justification change the moods of the players? Would the controversy of this game be the same? I honestly do not think it would have gotten as bad of a reaction from the public.</p>

Some of the focal points discussed in class and in the posts were the level of difficulty of games, the interruptibility of games and the overall juiciness of games.</p>
<p>In terms of preferring a game to be too easy or too difficult, according to the survey taken in class the majority of the class found that a game being too easy was worse than a game being too difficult. I myself, although not an avid gamer, completely disagree. I think that if a game is too easy, you and your level of gaming skills may be what prevent you from playing. I think this definitely speaks to how much weight a gamer feels the usability of the game should have. However, if a game is too difficult, the game itself is what prevents you from playing. I also think the purpose of why one plays factors into whether the degree of difficulty is of a significant importance. Since my personal goal of playing games is to be distracted for a short period of time and then return to the real world, a game being too easy does not deter from playing me all that much.</p>
<p>What I have realized is that the above truly relates to the interruptibility and the juiciness of the game. Interruptiblity as discussed in class pertains to how easy it is to stop and start a game. Given that my own goal is to quickly get distracted from the world for a short period of time, interruptibility is an important factor. Similarly when playing the two casual games infront of the class we see that the juiciness helps in whether or not one desires to interrupt the game. I noticed that juiciness may in fact have a correlation to the flow or getting into the zone of a game. Â The author of the blog <em>Escape from Reality in Virtual Simulation</em> said, âI think that almost all gamers begin a game in order to escape from realityâ¦The better a game simulates an alternate reality, the more of an escape it can offer. Angry Birds and Left for Dead both provide an escape, but Left for Dead is a better simulation of an alternate reality, therefore it draws in more hardcore gamers.â Hence I relate this idea of good simulation to our discussion on juiciness. Yes, juiciness is described as excessive positive feedback but if you are looking for an alternate world and the graphics progressively feel more and more like a virtual reality, do graphics not then serve as a positive feedback? Perhaps you may argue that the fiction valence is more appropriately connected? I would question then where does the argument hold when one considers the players autonomy to choose as the this author says, âThe type of reality a player wishes to engage in is their preference for a positive or negative game world fiction.â?</p>

Â While some games, like those found on mobile devices, purposefully allow sounds and music to be turned off, this option is created more for the convenience of the consumer than to somehow enhance the game itself. Â Additionally, these mobile games are designed to be playable without sound, if necessary, so supposedly the music in these games don&#8217;t have a huge impact on the perception of the game. Â However, is it possible that gameplay can actually be enhanced by the absence of music? Â For example, if music that&#8217;s in the minor scale or sounds similar to a heartbeat, like the music in the Underground in Super Mario Bros. 3, can cause players to be unsettled, then couldn&#8217;t a lack of music be used as a method to unsettle the player too? Â VIANNEY mentioned that one reason that minor scale music might make us feel uncomfortable is due to the fact that we could compare it to human sighs and moans. Â Similarly, an absence of music in a game could possibly beÂ reminiscentÂ of times in our life when were lonely or depressed. Â I think that survival horror video game could work very well without any music in the background, especially if there were some realistic sounds of footsteps and/or breathing of the main game character. Â Additionally, a game could temporarily work with with no sounds at all if it was meant to create uncertainty or suspense about what&#8217;s going to happen in the game. Â Are there any other ways that you can think of where a lack of music in a game could enhance gameplay?</p>

Â A popular game may go unplayed for years, but if it can be remembered instantly as demonstrated in class on Tuesday with the Super Mario sounds.</p>
<p>What I found most interesting is how a particular sound can cause a certain emotion. Â There was a lot of discussion in class about why a sound brings about a certain feeling or emotion in someone. Â Is it because the sound naturally elicits the emotion or have we been classically conditioned to feel certain ways with the introduction of a particular sound? Â Both may be correct.</p>
<p>But the sounds we hear in Mario for instance, such as the coin collection, growing from eating the mushroom, and falling, we only only associate those sounds with those actions because we have been trained to do so, otherwise they hold no meaning. Â I&#8217;m sure the makers of Super Mario picked those sounds to try to best capture the action that was being performed. Â But how did the makers decide those sounds would fit best? Â It&#8217;s the nature vs. nurture / natural or conditioned question all over again.</p>

Â While I agree that the capabilities of these platforms are expanding, I still believe that total convergence will never happen for two reasons. Â First, having a system that can perform a huge variety of tasks has great potential to be confusing and cluttered, especially to users that aren&#8217;t very familiar with technology. Â Many people purchase pieces of technology because they are looking for it to perform a single function and don&#8217;t want a lot of bells and whistles; I&#8217;m sure we all have a parent or grandparent who maintains that they just want a phone that can make phone calls, and who bemoan the fact that they can never find the call button on their phones because of all of the extra programs. Â Another reason why this convergence of platforms probably won&#8217;t happen is the cost; for example, if people just want a DVD player, they aren&#8217;t going to be happy when they have to cough up $500 for a system that can play music, run games, and surf the internet as well. Â Many people invest in only a few kinds of technology and have no need for a system that can do everything; therefore, it isn&#8217;t practical for them to buy a system that costs so much more because it offers capabilities that they don&#8217;t want. Â This consumer desire can play a major role in how technology will advance. Â For these reasons, I would disagree with the previous posts that state that platforms will integrate and becomeÂ homogeneous.</p>

Older platforms simply just did not have the physical capability (whether it be a soundcard, or memory) to play many musical tones. As systems progressed, so did the sound. You can clearly see the difference between the 8 bit atari system and the musical sounds in super mario for the nintendo. Later on elaborate music could be added to games once cds came into the video game world with the Sony Playstation. and as systems and speakers became more advanced, the complexity of music in video games was able to increase. This is a case where the physical technology, held back the advancement of the musical performance</p>
<p>Linking sounds and music to the movements of a character has a big part on the way players experience their gameplay. The term &#8220;mickey mousing&#8221; is used to describe this effect. It makes the movements oof characters unforgettable, such as how we all know what is happening in a Mario game just by the sounds we hear and not actually watching the game.</p>
<p>The music in the background of videogames also gives the audience an individual feeling based on Â the tone and sound of the music. For example the happy bubbly music when you are in the Mario Overworld as opposed to the Mario Underworld. Most people feel scared and anxious when listening to the minor chords and sounds in the underworld, causing gameplay to be hastened and less carefree.</p>

He points out conditions of long working hours, working in isolation, and doing repetitive tasks for low pay. The emphasis on the suicide statistic urges us to feel guilt and care about the situation so we can bring about change.</p>
<p>But why should I feel guilty? This article was far from an ethos based document. Joel Johnson loses credibility after admitting to manipulate Foxconn. What is to say he isn&#8217;t doing the same in his appeals to our emotion. He passionately points to the statistics but as we discussed in class the statistics are actually better than in relation with the rest of China. They have the opportunity to earn a constant wage which they would not have had had it not been for Foxconn and the suicide rate is much lower.</p>
<p>In comparison with America&#8217;s standard of living and working conditions Foxconn is lagging far behind, but if we compare Foxconn with the rest of China they are much better off. It is true that our consumer dollar contributed to these suicides but at the same time it is our dollar that helps aÂ millionÂ more families earn a living. By feeling guilt and not buying these products we would be harming more than helping those who work in these &#8220;inhumane&#8221; conditions. I agree with Joel Johnson&#8217;s message to improve working conditions and raise awareness but I disagree with his method.Â Rather we should try to raise awareness on our ends without guilt tripping consumers. We should advocate workers in Foxconn Â and elsewhere to appeal for better working conditions. Change will only happen from within.</p>

After reading through the first-readers posts, I was surprised at how many people took an attitude of informed indifference.</p>
<p>As Americans, we are on the far end of the spectrum of worldly comforts and conveniences. We expect a certain high standard for material goods. It&#8217;s not partaking in some of the conveniences that these goods and electronics afford us that I think is bad, but our culture has taken materialistic extravagance to an unprecedented level.</p>
<p>In his article, Joel Johnson definitely tries to pressure the reader into a feeling of guilt over the origins of his electronic device. While his reasoning is somewhat off &#8211; for example, focusing on the relatively low number of suicides at Foxconn &#8211; there is indeed some guilt to be placed, on him and the readers alike.</p>
<p>The working conditions are not humane. Many people work the same jobs for months at a time, forming injuries from repetitive movements. But this could easily be corrected by switching up the workers stations. The workers do not get to spend adequate time with family and friends. This is probably the largest contribution to the suicides. Humans are social creatures, living in societies, and interpersonal interaction is necessary for mental health. Additionally, we as people need purpose and goals. By allowing some form of upward movement within the factories, people would not only want to work harder but would have a better outlook for their future.</p>
<p>In short, if our culture is going to continue in it&#8217;s materialistic indulgence, then it&#8217;s our responsibility to at least be concerned about the conditions of the workers that make our products. And if small improvements can be made to those conditions, the informed people should advocate for them. Mind you, this is all easier said than done and I am just as guilty as anyone else&#8230;</p>

Call it the white man&#8217;s burden, first worlder guilt, whatever.</p>
<p>Guilt is actually the way our society founds itself (the other major societal structure is based on shame), to keep members of said society in line et cetera. This is why we consider those who don&#8217;t feel guilt to be suffering from a serious mental disorder.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that guilt is a natural occurrence in such a circumstance, but it is up to the informed person to decide whether they *should* feel this guilt. Should you take this burden of guilt just because the journalist says so? Probably not.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as with most statistics, it&#8217;s very easy to reinterpret them to suit the particular aims you have, as we&#8217;ve suggested extensively was the case in class.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a little note: Phone Story would have to have been programmed on a computer for which there was just as much guilt to be had.</p>

<div></div>
<p style="margin-top: 10px">What stood out to me from class on Tuesday was the argument that Joel Johnson made in the on Wired.com</p>
<p>First off, he exhibited poor <em>logos</em>. The nets that prevented workers from jumping from the top of the factory was the main focus of his article. But this showed poor logic.Â  Is this really the most important information about the Foxconn factories? 17 suicides in 5 years is nothing compared to college student suicide rates, as he says himself in the article. If this is the case, then why highlight the sparse number of self-inflicted deaths in the piece? He himself says: <em>&#8220;That 17 people have committed suicide at Foxconn is a tragedy. But in fact, the suicide rate at Foxconnâs Shenzhen plant remains below <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suiciderates/en/">national averages</a> for both rural and urban China, a bleak but unassailable fact that does much to exonerate the conditions at Foxconn and absolutely nothing to bring those 17 people back.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Why bring make the nets that prevent these suicides the main feature of the article? It just doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>Secondly, his <em>pathos</em> argument is poor. He tries to guilt trip Apple users into feeling bad for the 17 deaths in Foxconn. Though those deaths are tragic, we are not responsible for them. The workers in Foxconn are not throwing themselves off rooftops left and right. The less than ideal living conditions are a valid point that he makes though, as the workers are not much better off than college students.</p>
<p>Thirdly, his<em> ethos</em> as a writer is believable because he is a writer for Gizmodo.com and conducted thorough interviews. The details about the living conditions, long hours, and the repetitive work all show that he was meticulous in his reporting.</p>

The sheer size of the factory as well as the huge amount of people working in an assembly line-like process is something I have never witnessed here in the United States. I also agree with others that the working hours for the employees of this company are unnecessarily high and should receive notice on the international stage. However, even though I am an owner of an iPhone, I do not feel personally responsible for the poor working conditions of these employees. I do think that knowing the background of how our electronic devices are made is important, and I also believe that knowledge of potentially unfair working conditions for the people assembling these products should be shared. But it is not going to prevent me from buying these new devices.</p>
<p>I found the discussion we had in class regarding the availability of other jobs to Chinese citizens to be quite interesting. A point was argued multiple times that the majority of the people living in China do not have access to a job as stable as the one held by many of the employees of the Foxconn factory. Based on the arguments made in class and the fact that China is a nation of over a billion people, I believe that a job at a place like the Foxconn company provides enough needs and benefits in order to satisfy the majority of the Chinese people.</p>

However, if people really lean towards familiarity, how has the video game industry come this far? Most of today&#8217;s top games contain not only unfamiliar (to most) ideas, but also unrealistic ones. Casting spells, collecting magical artifacts, and killing monsters are just a few examples. One might say that the gaming industry has been incorporating these concepts into video games for a very long time, and that would be correct. But it had to start somewhere! The very firstÂ video game, <em>Pong,</em>Â had absolutely no violence or mystical creatures. Assuming that people prefer familiarity over exploration it would be very difficult to explain how video games have changed so drastically.</p>
<p>There is another reason it is hard for me to believe that people enjoy familiarity. Sure, spaceships may have been well known to the creators of the old-school space games, but not many of the American citizens were astronauts or had any knowledge about spaceships. Yet somehow, not long after its release,Â <em>Computer Space</em>Â became one of the most played arcade games. As BBAKER8 mentions in his post, the arcade game business was about eight billion dollars in 1982! Clearly, people were interested in something completely new, as opposed to sticking to their familiar ways of entertaining.</p>
<p>If we take one more step backwards in time, we can see that the discovering/invention of video games was itself an act of breaking away from what was familiar. <em>Pong</em>Â was first created on an oscilloscope, which was (and still is) only meant to display electronic signals. It took creativity and curiosity to turn this boring piece of equipment (as it&#8217;s usually thought of) into something fun. It took desire to find something unfamiliar.</p>
<p>To think about:<br />
Was &#8220;Pong&#8221;Â <em>invented</em> or <em>discovered?</em></p>

As we learned from the documentary that we watched in class on Tuesday, the first video games were created largely from the creativity and curiosity of military engineers. The industry began in order for the engineers to have an outlet for their creativity and a diversion from the stresses of their jobs. These early games largely existed outside of the market as they were not created for profit, strictly for the enjoyment of those who created them.</p>
<p>The industry that we see today is completely different than the industry of the late 50&#8242;s and early 60&#8242;s. Today we see games such as Call of Duty and Madden that release a new title every year with very few changes to the gameplay. Games such as these two, as well as many others, are motivated primarily by profit margin rather than innovation and creativity. I think the reason that games like Call of Duty continue to break sales records without much innovation is because so many people enjoy their multiplayer online gameplay. Many people play online with a group of friends, so if a few of the people in the group get the new version of the game, the rest of the group will usually follow. This is because they will not get the same online experience if they do not get the new version. Their game experience will change not because there is a huge change in gameplay, it will change due to the simple fact that everyone will no longer play the older version and hence their online experience will suffer due to lack of competition online. Whether for better or worse, the video game industry has completely changed.</p>

I agree that the fun in designing the games was not just the representation of a ship as a collection of dots in a certain formation, but rather the significance of those dots. Whereas before they would have been some data presented for some work-related purpose, now they took on the meaning of a ship. The imagination necessary in thinking of the dots as a ship was where fun was, as that imagination was absent in using the computer for work related purposes.</p>
<p>However, I also feel that a large portion of the enjoyment from creating games came from the simple feeling of creating something. Making something like a building, food dish, painting, knit sweater, or anything else gives a sense of accomplishment, and it is the same with programming games. But there is also the satisfaction gained from overcoming challenges that contributes to the drive to create. As a computer science student, I&#8217;ve had to do a significant amount of programming, and a lot of the fun is from the puzzle-like nature of figuring out how to design a certain feature. The designers of these early video games must have felt that satisfaction, even more so because there was not really anything similar ever created before. Programming a game of tic-tac-toe can be rewarding when you finish, everything works, and you can say that you created it, but it must feel even better when you are the first one to create a tic-tac-toe computer game. For some, creating the game itself might have been more fun than actually playing it.</p>
