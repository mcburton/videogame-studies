Games that are used more to accurately tell a story of the past than to simply be enjoyed as games. Today you always hear gamers talk about how realistic games are becoming and how the games they play make them feel as if they are right there in the action. No one ever complains about these games being too realistic for them to handle. Now looking at docu-games we see that people call these games &#8220;too real&#8221;. Is this due to some of the sensitive topics such as slavery in &#8220;Flight to Freedom&#8221; or the assassination of JFK in &#8220;JFK reloaded&#8221;? Despite the negative comments about these video games, there is a lot of new information to be learned from them. Games like &#8220;The Cat and The Coup&#8221; tell of past events that you may not have heard of before. This game in particular covers the CIA bringing upon the downfall of a democratically elected leader of Iran.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interactivedocumentary.net/2011/10/22/the-cat-and-the-coup/">http://www.interactivedocumentary.net/2011/10/22/the-cat-and-the-coup/</a></p>
<p>I know I never knew about an incident like this. I think that if critics looked more at the teaching aspects of these games rather than what is considered to be the insensitivity of the games themselves, then a better market and acceptance of these games can be created.</p>

The modding group&#8217;s actions would generally come under Galloway&#8217;s 1st category of game mods: the mod involves changing the game at the design level (changing levels and incorporating new features into the game.) This blog post for Forbes.com discusses how many recent mods have had highly successful outcomes and cites Skyrim for the PC as an example of how fans&#8217; influence on a game can elevate the game to extraordinary levels.  The blog also discusses whether modding is a threat to the &#8220;art&#8221; of videogames and suggests that the act of modding is, in fact, a form of art.  This can readily be put in Bogost&#8217;s terms as he states in his chapter on &#8220;Art&#8221; that art&#8217;s purpose is &#8220;to change, and to change us along with it&#8221; (Bogost 11.)  Clearly, modding is a form of change and can provoke new thought in game players.  Therefore, modding is most likely not the death of art, but <em>is</em> art!</p>

<p>An example of a game that focuses more on the thoughts of the player then on the game&#8217;s action is <em>The Cat and the Coup</em>.  The game retells the story of Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh, through the eyes of his cat.  Moussadegh was the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran and was assassinated during a CIA engineered coup in 1953.  As the player, you take the role of the cat in helping Moussadegh progress through different rooms that retell the story of his life and his death.  The game doesn&#8217;t focus on actions but, instead, on solving puzzles and reflecting on the events that eventually led to the death of Moussadegh.  While it is hard to produce a game like this without having some personal beliefs leak through, a docu-game definitely allows the player to be more thoughtful about historical and political issues.  Ultimately, like any documentary, it is up to the player whether to trust the facts given and to agree or disagree with certain implied beliefs in docu-games.</p>

<p>Lionsgate, the company which owns the rights to &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; film series is planning on turning the movie into a console videogame. The news article below debates the pros and cons of a videogame release.  There is already a mild facebook version, but the potential of a full scale game has created much controversy.</p>
<p>In summary, &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; is about 24 kids sent to an arena that must fight to the death until there is one remaining victor.  The storyline has great potential for a videogame, but the themes may be too much considering the primary fan following is  middle-school aged kids.  Modern videogames don&#8217;t exactly have a history of being mild, and kids killing kids is a very risky area for a game with such a young audience.</p>
<p>Many who were skeptical of the movie are even more uncertain about a videogame.  “While parents might be able to talk themselves into letting their kids see the movie, because the violence is masked by various PG-13 filmic techniques, there isn&#8217;t much chance of that happening in video-game land,” writes Matthew DeBord on the Southern California Public Radio website.</p>
<p>However, a &#8220;Hunger Games&#8221; videogame could suffer the same fate as many other movie franchise related videogames such as Electronic Arts&#8217; &#8220;Harry Potter.&#8221;  Nonetheless, with the high publicity of the movie, this article predicts the game will be at least mildly successful.  I guess we&#8217;ll have to wait until the game comes out to see its true effect.</p>

Visual appearance ties in with the graphics processor and effects are add-ons that simulate reality such as the rumble pack. As discussed in class, the future of videogames is moving towards 3 dimensional game play. With the advancements made to graphics cards and the output screens, one can feel immersed in the game because the texture comes to life.</p>
<p>In the book Bogost states “Developers render the visual aspects of videogames worlds in excruciating detail. But those worlds remain imprisoned behind the glass of our televisions and our monitors”.  I would disagree with Bogost because with the era of 3D televisions, game designers have been racing to create games that can take advantage of the higher output capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://games.yahoo.com/blogs/plugged-in/rumor-next-playstation-coming-2013-200015017.html">http://games.yahoo.com/blogs/plugged-in/rumor-next-playstation-coming-2013-200015017.html</a></p>
<p>Each generation of hardware gets closer and closer to making us feel the simulated experience of gaming by improving visual and musical texture of the game. Sony’s new system that is rumored to begin seeing the market by next year is packed with high end specifications. The “Playstation 4” will come with the AMD Southern Islands graphics processing unit and will be capable of resolutions up to 4096&#215;2160. The system will be able to play 3D games in full 1080. The current PS3has a maximum 3D resolution of 720. What does this mean for us? It means playing in 3D will make a more believable simulated reality. The texture of future games that utilizes these specs will no longer be imprisoned behind the glass of our televisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 10px">A recent article on Tim Schafer quotes him saying that video games need to be funnier.</p>
<p><a title="Video Games Should Be Funnier, says Tim Schafer" href="http://kotaku.com/5895770/video-games-should-be-funnier-says-tim-schafer/">http://kotaku.com/5895770/video-games-should-be-funnier-says-tim-schafer/</a></p>
<p>He is quoted as saying, &#8220;If the game is not funny, then you&#8217;re missing something.&#8221; The most recent game that he&#8217;s developed, <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, caters specifically to this need. It is a text-based game that features a pirate named Guybrush Threepwood as the main character. The game is centered around the player attempting to solve puzzles and riddles, but with a funny spin-off.</p>
<p>In one part of the game, Guybrush falls in love with Governor Elaine Marley. Schafer was given the task of writing the love scene. But in five lines.</p>
<p>Phrases like &#8220;plunder bunny&#8221; and &#8220;honey pumpkin&#8221; tell us that this isn&#8217;t supposed to be taken seriously.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPZ2F5MCNrs">Monkey Island Remake &#8211; Guybrush &amp; Elaine </a></p>
<p>I think that this element of humor could be added to Bogost&#8217;s chapter on<em> Relaxation</em>. He mentions the idea that video games should allow a player to &#8220;lean back.&#8221; What better way to lean back and have some fun than to add a bit of humor into a game? It would have served Bogost well to at least mention this in his chapter on <em>Relaxation</em>. Humor keeps the player interested. It also blurs the line between a gamer being active and passive. If you add too much humor, how much is the player really engaged in the video game? If too little, will the gamer will get bored and walk away?</p>
<p>So how can video game designers successfully incorporate humor into their games?</p>

</em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/playdrawsomething">http://www.facebook.com/playdrawsomething</a></p>
<p>This is a game that I am currently playing on my iPhone, and can be played on other platforms such as Android or on Facebook. The game allows you to challenge your friends by drawing a word while they attempt to guess. You can have multiple games going at a time, and each turn takes merely seconds. It is a fast paced, casual game… or so I thought. The reason for mentioning this game is because of the structure that is underlying. At first, it appears that playing consists of only drawing and guessing. Each time a drawing is guessed correctly, both players earn points determined by the difficulty of the word. With these points you are able to purchase more colors to add to your personal palette. It is this particular feature that intrigues me.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the game?<br />
–To obtain points.<br />
–To obtain colors.<br />
–To “play.”</p>
<p>I had been playing for a while and I noticed that I had a significant amount of points. After clicking around I discovered that while in game play (drawing) is where you choose to buy additional colors, not in the settings menu. This is an interesting design choice by the creator of the game. Playing this game and experiencing this specific style of menu interface made me aware of my interactions with the menu system, where I would normally just play without thinking.</p>
<p>As we have seen from the games played in class, some games have a distinct menu system while others place the player in the midst of the action and just “go.” This leads me to believe that it may be easier to pick up and go with games that have a menu that allows for start/stop/save/pause verses a game with predetermined checkpoints or a less clear structure. I will continue to consider the menu style of games as I play them, and I encourage you to do the same.</p>

With transportation options like cars and planes, distances become trivial and the ride itself to a new location is not as emphasized as it used to be. Games, however, can recreate the feeling of traveling a long way, along with the feelings of exploration and familiarity that one gains as they travel through the same areas over multiple trips. The game ArcheAge, an unreleased Korean MMORPG, has a large explorable world, but tries to avoid fast travel mechanics that can be found in other games, such as portals or simply mysteriously teleporting to places. Instead, players are provided with a variety of modes of transportation, as can be seen in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLPnOGe0gnE">video</a>. Players can not only ride on animals, but also ride carriages and blimps that come at scheduled intervals. Players can also create boats and then sail them in the ocean to reach other islands, and finally there are also hang gliders that can be used for soaring around. All of these options combined with the scale of the world provide that feeling of embarking on a journey, in ways familiar to us like carriages (well, buses in modern day I suppose) but also in ways that can not be easily experienced in real life, such as hang gliding, blimps, and sailing your own boat.</p>

However, when we play a video game we usually get so lost in the gameplay that we forget to enjoy the game&#8217;s artistic side. In order to avoid arguments about what can or cannot be considered artistic, I&#8217;ll focus on music, images, and videos, all of which are very popular art forms. I&#8217;m sure everyone remembers playing Super Mario for hours&#8230; Didn&#8217;t we get to a point (usually early in the game) where we started thinking of the music merely as a background melody? Well, someone (Koji Kondo) had to get creative and come up with it! And if the theme song doesn&#8217;t sound very good, it&#8217;s probably because of the capabilities of the old Nintendo consoles. But check out this interpretation by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcKurvm_0oE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcKurvm_0oE</a></p>
<p>Even though I have never played any of the Legends of Zelda games, I can definitely appreciate the art, skills, and imagination that were necessary to create all of the characters in the game. The following image is a stunning depiction of the game. Its details and structure are (at least to me) reminiscent of some of the greatest paintings of all time.</p>
<p><a href="http://furiousfanboys.com/2011/02/the-legend-of-zelda-25th-anniversary/">http://furiousfanboys.com/2011/02/the-legend-of-zelda-25th-anniversary/</a></p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to present a short film based on the video game Portal. I believe that those who have already played the game will be able to relate to the main character. The &#8220;no escape&#8221; feeling is exactly what Portal brings to you. Of course, once you figure out how to get through a level, there is a rush of happiness, but not for too long &#8211; you move on to a bigger and more confusing chamber. This video reminds me that Portal is basically an interactive fictional movie &#8211; something I forget about while trying to make my way through the game.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk</a></p>
<p>PS: For those who have not played the game yet, I hope this serves as a brief introduction to how portals work and what you can do with them. Have fun!</p>

<p>An interesting little opinion article on CNET voices a rebuke to Apple&#8217;s marketing in the name of gaming consoles. Specifically, the writer takes issue with some comparisons made between the iPad 3 and current established &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gaming consoles, i.e. the XBOX 360 and PS3. While it may seem somewhat petty, the primary issue addressed is with the comparisons&#8217; implications that the iPad may somehow be attempting to legitimize itself in the gaming world as something more than a casual platform. Personally, I feel it rather unwise of Apple to risk annoying console fans unless they really plan on releasing something more&#8230; well.. console-y. The casual games market for portable devices is anything but lacking.</p>

Because of the fiction, interruptibility, difficult and punishment, and juiceness of casual games, they often leave gamers transfixed. Because gamers feel as if they can stop playing at anytime they do not mind playing &#8220;just one more level&#8221;. However, because casual games are difficult but not too difficult a gamer like myself feels like he or she can complete the game rather quickly. As is evidenced by sites like addictingames.com and games on that site like <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/action-games/bloons.jsp">http://www.addictinggames.com/action-games/bloons.jsp</a>. This being said the transfixion that video games leave gamers in are not trances of a vegetative-like state but rather trances where neutron circuits (Hotz). In a study published by the Wall Street Journal Robert Lee Hotz lets informs us that, &#8220;Almost any computer game appears to boost a child&#8217;s creativity, researchers at Michigan State University&#8217;s Children and Technology Project reported in November&#8221;. Video games make us smarter.</p>

As the smart phone market exploded with the introduction of Apple&#8217;s iPhone and Google&#8217;s Android and the introduction of the app markets, the number of games available in the &#8220;games&#8221; category of the app markets skyrocketed. These games range from simple versions of Brick Breaker to wildly popular games like Angry Birds. So what led to this casual game explosion in the smart phone app market?</p>
<p>The answer, according to PadGadget.com, are Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s extremely developer-friendly policies. Apple and Google have designed their app markets to be extremely accessible to developers seeking to design, build, and market their games. In fact, both Google and Apple have made the tools needed to design and build games easily accessible to developers. These policies, combined with the accessibility and name-recognition that comes from affiliation with the Apple and Google app markets, has led to a huge increase in the number of independent game developers being able to market their products. According to data published on PadGadget.com, indie game developers comprised 68 percent of game developers in the iOS and Android game markets in first quarter 2012. Interestingly enough, indie developers have not had such an easy time with platform development, which is dominated by big entertainment firms and extremely advanced technology that is not cheap. In short, you couldn&#8217;t design an Xbox 360 game from your home and compete with companies like Activision and Electronic Arts.</p>
<p>So, what does this indie success mean? Will this mean larger independent control over the casual smart phone gaming market and more competition? Or, will we see a consolidation of the most popular developers and the eventual monopoly over the smart phone gaming market by a select few? As of now, it doesn&#8217;t seem very clear, but it looks like Google&#8217;s and Apple&#8217;s egalitarian approach is empowering normal, independent developers to make exciting new games that are changing the way we view casual mobile games. Let&#8217;s hope it stays that way!</p>

The game is called Infinity Blade 2 and already critics are in love with this fun iPhone game. The game combines hardcore elements like a negative fiction setting, high graphics and plenty of action. However, the game also has casual characteristics like interruptibility, usability, and juiciness. A female friend of mine is addicted to the game and admits that she plays five to ten minutes at work or in class. So is this the beginning of a crossing over of video game types? Decide for yourself with this video.</p>

<p>Above is a link to a portion of the 1934 Chinese silent film <em>The Goddess. </em>In its pivotal scene, there&#8217;s a switch to a shot (starting at 6:14) that employs the first-person perspective that puts the audience in the shoes of the scumbag character who is about to get what&#8217;s coming to him from the main protagonist. I thought this might be interesting to share because it is a very early example of the subjective shot used in cinema to elicit a general feeling of uneasiness and sudden self-awareness in a film. Contrary to first person shooters, where the perspective immerses the player in the game, this particular shot is jarring. Camera movements in the silent film days were very limited- in this film, the camera doesn&#8217;t really move at all with the exception of this scene where it tracks backward ever so slightly, giving the illusion that the antagonist is leaning backward, yet paralyzed, and really making this shot exceptional. The protagonist stares directly into the camera, breaking that fourth wall, and breaks the bottle on the camera. It cuts away, back to a third-person view, to show the damage and never resumes a first-person shot. In this case, the shot is used very impactfully and artistically, but if the entire movie had been filmed in such a way it would lose that impact.</p>
