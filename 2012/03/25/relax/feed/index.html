		<description>I think you&#039;re onto something about the difficulty of using a medium that &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; action (as Galloway made clear in his first chapter) to promote relaxation or even meditation. I guess there are two responses to this critique: (1) is there a way games can foster stillness over motion? And (2) can repetitive actions ever be relaxing? I think of something like knitting, which I know a lot of people find relaxing, almost meditative, even though it requires skill and physical activity.</description>
