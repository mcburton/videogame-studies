		<description>That&#039;s a very good question about how far can a game push its non-diegetic acts without becoming something other than a game. Aside from the case of Jodi (which we&#039;ll read more about later this semester), I wonder if there are other, more mainstream games (sports, board, or video) in which the non-diegetic acts threaten to overwhelm the diegetic ones. (Side note: Huizinga didn&#039;t actually call Jodi &quot;spoilsports&quot;; Galloway just means to say that according to Huizinga&#039;s definitions, that&#039;s what Jodi would appear to be.)</description>
