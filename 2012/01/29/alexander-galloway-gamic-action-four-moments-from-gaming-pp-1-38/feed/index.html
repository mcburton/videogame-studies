		<description>I would definitely agree that the same logic would apply to video games because video games often require the user to accept an alternative reality that is very different from true reality.  Thus, people who regard the game as trivial and refuse to play would be extremely damaging to the game world because of the fact that a video game is based on the user accepting the general premise of the game.  Therefore, the power of dismissive thinking is greater with video games than for games such as card games, where there is not such a leap of imagination required in order for the game to progress.</description>

		<description>This question of cheating also made me think of what Caillois said about the cheater not being nearly as threatening to the game as the nihilist who refuses to play. Do you think the same logic holds true when talking about videogames (as opposed to, say, card games)?</description>
