		<description>I&#039;m reluctant to rely entirely on a basic supply and demand graph to explain the videogame crash in the early 80s. Certainly there was an abundance of games (and an overabundance of not very good games), but there were many other factors at work. Some of the largest companies made bad investments. Fluctuating manufacturing costs played a role. And perhaps the biggest disruptor of the videogame market was the emergence of home computers. So it wasn&#039;t just that there was too little demand; in fact, there was a great demand, but much of it shifted to the much more versatile early PCs.</description>
