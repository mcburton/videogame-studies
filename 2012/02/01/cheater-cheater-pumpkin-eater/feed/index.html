		<description>I am afraid to spoil one of the story arcs for you, but the name of the book is &quot;Oghma Infinium&quot;. The difference for me is the role-playing aspect of Skyrim. You start off weak and puny, progressively becoming stronger as you fight enemies. There is hardly an effort to be made when receiving an RPG in GTA. You instantly become stronger rather than working towards it. I feel that shooters are starting to recognize the &quot;leveling up&quot; aspect of video games such as COD and BF3, games that make you play in order to unlock essential guns and additions to make you stronger.</description>

		<description>My first impulse upon reading this post is to ask, what&#039;s the book and where do I find it. But then I stop myself, knowing that---as you found out---when games become too easy they also become boring.

Yet there&#039;s a paradox, as you imply. There are plenty of cheats in &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt; that give the player-character god-like powers. In this case, though, the game doesn&#039;t become dull; it can in fact become more interesting to play. So what&#039;s the difference between &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;?</description>
