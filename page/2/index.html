<p>With an MMO, the designer also needs to think about the large amounts of players that will try to take on quests at the same time.  Problems, like large lines to get to an NPC or waiting for a dungeon to reset itself for the next group of players, can cause players to get frustrated.  Some solutions we looked at for this problem would be having a seperately generated dungeon appear for parties or having a large area that allows multiple player to help in a quest and all recieve some sort of reward.</p>

I&#8217;ll be going, fingers crossed, into the games industry as a game artist, but I&#8217;ve had a little taste of game writing in one of Seth Hudson&#8217;s classes and I really like it. Laura Packer&#8217;s morning workshop was a good way to ease into the day. The woman is a very talented storyteller, and the creative exercises she had us participate in really began renewing my interest in creative writing, which I haven&#8217;t done in a while. She had us doing goofy improv games in groups to stir up ideas and create some really off-the-wall stories. What she stressed, here, was the importance of having a group to brainstorm with and bounce ideas off of, because collaboration is really where the best story elements are conjured in conjunction with improv; we&#8217;ll often come up with more novel ideas when put on the spot in a group setting and BSing the next line of a narrative.</p>
<p>The importance of having a group of people to bounce ideas off of was a point emphasized also by Rowland Cox. He stressed the importance of having a &#8220;circle of trust&#8221;; a group of people who will listen to you and give you constructive criticism on your ideas. The industry can be cruel, and maturing your ideas with a small group of others first and thickening your rhino skin will help you succeed more in the industry. The biggest thing he talked about, though, was passion. You&#8217;ve got to love what you do. You&#8217;ve got to know what you love about it. You&#8217;ve got to be able to pull from an arsenal of references, whether they be textual, gamic, or filmic in nature, to get across to others what you love. This probably hit truest to what I lack currently. I have a huge passion for video games (and making them), and going to see all the recent Marvel films in sequence before I watch the Avengers already makes me giddy as a kid on Christmas day, I haven&#8217;t thought too deeply about why I love what I love. The passion&#8217;s there, I just need to find it&#8217;s source, and I relish that advice. Anyway, I really liked that he asked the audience members questions, too, engaging them in conversation. It was refreshing and the atmosphere was nice.</p>
<p>Ken Rolston, though, wow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been to such an energetic presentation before. He was honest, he was fun, he was unafraid, and he shone as brightly as the sun with lethal positivity. He stressed a lot of things- the importance of collecting literature, flyers, etc. to use as references, learning from tabletop games, maintaining an excessively positive attitude in the workplace to get what you want, failing fast, hard, and dramatically, stealing stuff, and the power of donuts. It was incredibly fast-paced, and he had a lot of information to give, but what I absorbed was very helpful and I have a lot of respect for the man. He terrifies me just a wee bit (that extreme positivity and confidence helps, I think) but I admire the way he operates and I think that&#8217;s something to aspire to. He came out of retirement to keep working on and perfecting games; you can see that he loves what he does.</p>

But one genre that has been overlooked is interactive fiction. Unlike traditional games, interactive fiction is a text based game that is not concerned with aesthetics or poetics. The focus is on action and reaction by the program to guide you through some world. As Nick Montfort wrote, many view Interactive Fiction as a work of fiction rather than a game of fiction.</p>
<p>Some arguments in favor of interactive fiction being classified a game would be the ability for interactivity of a player with the machine. Player inputs are diegetic actions that define most games. Interactive fiction is played not by randomly typing in words but by using specific verbs. These action words give a sense of “playing” the fiction rather than reading a work of fiction.  Interactive fiction also textually simulates worlds. Videogames are known for simulated reality which parallels interactive fiction.</p>
<p>Unlike a traditional game there are many aspects of “gaming” that is limited or completely excluded in interactive fiction. An interactive fiction is a world that can be explored but has no quest. There is no concept of winning or final replay.  This is similar to the “games” we have explored in the past like driving the bus for 8 hours gives you 1 point but no clear winner, and the Mario clouds game that offer no quest but visual appeal. Would we classify these as games? If so, then should we then consider interactive fictions to be games as well?</p>

<p>MC Frontalot (and to a similar extent, the video editor Jason Scott) demonstrates an understanding of what makes the text adventure so very fun.</p>
<p>Which is sort of the odd thing, text adventures aren&#8217;t really gone, they&#8217;ve just had to adapt to a changing world. Unfortunately, the only game of the type I can readily come up with an example for has lewd content. Originally titled Softporn Adventure, Leisure Suit Larry was a &#8220;classic&#8221; text adventure of the time, and several games later it has had two unsuccessful (pornographic games don&#8217;t sell well) outings in 3D, with both traditional text adventure elements and the introduction of coordination tests. Who knew watching X-play back when it was on techTV could come in handy. Interestingly, according to wikipedia, the latest game in the series features no nudity or explicit sexual situations.</p>
<p>After that little sidetrack, let&#8217;s get back to the point.</p>
<p>Interactive Fiction is mostly worth noting as, while not the first form of video game, it was the most prolific for a long period of time, and helped flesh out the concept of a video game, as more than just a coordination test, a la Pac Man; Asteroids; etc. This bleed-back can be seen as early as the game Sinistar. Compare:<br />
Asteroids: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZfsnA7dAHI<br />
Sinistar: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcyBtVwAsfg &#8211; Please watch Sinistar with SOUND</p>
<p>What I am arguing here is that interactive fiction not only made puzzling a part of video games, but also made story an integral function. Sinistar is not merely a particularly powerful and frustrating opponent, but also an entity. He has a philosophy: http://onastick.net/drew/sinistar/ yet ultimately the gameplay is functionally on par with that of Asteroids.</p>
<p>He is also beyond terrifying in a video-game concept. Dwarfing your ship, Sinistar is an organic entity with a single-minded purpose, being to destroy you, and he is faster than you. Fortunately, you have ranged weapons he lacks, and his cornering could use some work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honestly not sure what else I can say about Interactive Fiction. It&#8217;s another genre of gaming, an old genre that many feel is dead. I almost feel like they&#8217;re more interesting for their narrative choices and incomprehensible methodology than as a game.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a few gems from interactive fiction:<br />
One of the King&#8217;s Quest games allowed you to pick locks, and become proficient at it. You could also pick your nose. If you were below a certain skill level, you would jam the lockpick up your nose and into your brain, killing you instantly. Above that level, you could practice your lockpicking skill by picking your nose. &#8220;Your Nose Is Now Open&#8221;</p>
<p>Another game had you meet a dragon, as many games did.<br />
&gt;Kill Dragon<br />
   What with, your bare hands?<br />
&gt;Yes<br />
Congratulations! You killed a dragon! Ain&#8217;t that something? ~(this line is paraphrased)</p>

He was speaking in order to inspire future game developers or writers, to give them advice and first-hand knowledge on what a job in the gaming industry is like today. He focused on five main takeaways that the audience should remember and utilize in their own careers.</p>
<p>1. Have an Indestructible Passion. Love what you do, and persevere.</p>
<p>2. Have a &#8220;Death Star Exploding&#8221; imagination. Innovative thoughts and their proper application are what sets successful games apart. He gave lists of books, movies, and games which he saw as influential and necessary to being well-read.</p>
<p>3. Know Thyself. Know what you love, what inspires you, what your childhood fantasies were.</p>
<p>4. Share Your Joy. Take your inspirations and fantasies and share them through your art.</p>
<p>5. Have a Circle of Trust. A close group of friends in which you can trust your unfinished ideas and greatest passions. These people can help you develop and review your ideas before you share them publicly.</p>
<p>He views all of these points as key to his successful career, and wishes to share them with the next generation of game developers, who he views as holding the future of the form of gaming in their hands. He finds that art happens accidentally, and comes from entertainment that reaches the next level of form.</p>

I do not find interactive fiction to be a videogame, regardless of whether or not it was intended to be one. Making it through the presented fictional story and memorizing the different commands felt like more of a chore rather than a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>The one thing I do appreciate about these games is their history. Because some of the first interactive fiction games have been around since the 1970&#8242;s, like <em>Adventure</em>, it feels as though I am getting a raw and classic experience. It makes me feel as though I am interacting with the basic logistics of a computer more so when compared to a complex modern videogame. Although I do see why interaction fiction generates interest, its not an experience that I will ever strive to obtain.</p>

The ones that stuck out most to me were Ken Rolston’s key note presentation, Laura Pecker’s workshop; Improvisational Story Telling for Game Development, and Keaven Freeman’s workshop; Quest Crafting: Maximizing Impact without a Wall of Text. Ken’s speech was really interesting and I never thought that so much about game writing can be learned from table top and paper game storytelling and overall design. As a want to be Game Designer I found that he had a lot of really good points for writing story for RPG’s, which as he said is the hardest genre of game to write for. I was a little disappointed that his presentation and all the others that I attended focused on writing for the genre of RPG or MMORPG. It would have been nice to get a taste of how writing may be different when you are working with  designing a Strategy game, First Person Shooter, Point and Click adventure, etc.</p>
<p>	What I loved so much about Laura Pecker’s workshop was that it was fun, and really helped me find my inner creativity. For those of you who did not attend we did small group collective story telling exercises that focused on speed and unpredictability. She said that whenever you find yourself stuck in a rut with your plot or a character, to try out one of these exercises to see what possibilities you can come up with.</p>
<p>	Keaven Freeman’s workshop was about designing quests that are fairly deep and complex, and how to streamline events and dialogue so that you do not bore the player with walls of text explaining what they must do. He said that the best way to say things about your game world or characters is to not say it at all. Instead of telling a player that a character does this or that, show them and have other characters in the world react and talk about things to give the player a hint without spilling the beans in front of  them outright. This was a point also made by Seamus Sullivan in his presentation on good dialogue. In all I felt that I learned a lot about game and character design,  tools to good storytelling and dialogue, writer to player relations, and a bunch about what exactly it means to be a writer or designer for a game. </p>

<p>The most important points of his presentation were his sources of inspiration and strategies for fostering creative and imaginative growth.  He spent time discussing the importance of passion.  The video game industry is tough and competitive. Passion is sustaining and vital, and it is the key ingredient to success, especially to survive the game industry.  It is what will get you up in the morning, and get you through the hard times when inspiration may be low.</p>
<p>When discussing sources of inspiration, Cox said, &#8220;What made your eyes light up as a child still has the power now&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; This quote really stood out to me during the session.  From his presentation, it seemed that most of his inspiration derived from childhood enjoyments and current forms of entertainment such as movies, books, and other video games.  People often forget what it takes to inspire them, but the answer is as simple as looking back into your childhood.  When he mentioned this point, this simple exercise brought me back to the sources of my inspiration, which is something that I have not thought about it a long time.</p>
<p>He brought up some very important points about inspiration within a professional setting.  Collaboration is essential to work in the video game industry.  However, a good strategy to employ is establishing &#8220;circles of trust.&#8221;  These circles are creative and inspirational outlets with trustworthy and supportive people inside and out of the professional environment.  Having &#8220;circles of trust&#8221; enables you to share your passion with other people in a constructive manner.  I thought this was a very valuable and worthwhile strategy for a long term career in the gaming industry or other inspiration-based industries.</p>

Ken gave a very quick but detailed presentation on what tools are useful for a narrative game designer. Some points that particularly stood out to me were the ideas of tactibility and a player’s emotional response to a game.</p>
<p>The topic of tactibility came up when discussing the importance of the quality of objects one uses in a narrative game. Narrative games are dense in their use of dialogue. Objects intentionally placed to interact with characters can give the player information in a more interactive or tactile way. An example of this was a worn train ticket. Rolston showed this image in his presentation and it sparked my interest. I wondered what are some things that a train ticket could say better than a dialogue among characters or the narrator and the player. A train ticket could tell the player, where they’re going or have been, or where some one else in the story has been or is going. What are other objects that can speak for themselves? Would an engraved ring or a planner do the same?</p>
<p>A connection I did not expect to make with narrative games is their attentiveness to the player’s emotional experience. Take the train ticket for example, what if the train ticket revealed that a loved one in the story planned to escape or runaway. This would most likely evoke a sense of sadness or anger due to betrayal; nonetheless the tactile object evoked a emotional response. Similarly Rolston discussed that fonts evoke different emotions as well. Fonts can take the player into a different time period and then evoke a sense of emotion through different perceptions. I found this idea to parallel our past discussion in regards to how music in games evoke an emotional response. I think fonts evoking a sense of emotion in a player is an idea we do not consciously notice but is a very powerful one. The emotions a font stirs up are not only valuable in narrative games but have value in other games as it could potentially sustain the mood of a game even while the player navigates menus or opening scenes. Are there other non-diegetic elements that purposefully evoke a subconscious emotional response from the player?</p>
