He argues that their interactive nature makes video games more akin to a simulation than to a narrative, and uses this perspective as a starting point to discuss how their potential for social critique might be better realized. To that end, he introduces Augusto Boal&#8217;s &#8220;Theater of the Oppressed,&#8221; which attempts to blend the roles of actor and spectator by methods such as &#8220;Forum Theater.&#8221; Boal&#8217;s &#8220;Forum Theater&#8221; consists of a group of people acting out a previously unscripted scene from some starting scenario; the initial scenario always presents some form of oppression or social conflict against the protagonist. When a person in the group thinks of a possible course of action for the protagonist, that person would share their idea by acting it out in character of the protagonist. This roundtable method of acting out a developing scene offers an interesting medium for discussion, and Frasca goes on to provide examples of how this might be achieved with video games. His adaptation of Boal&#8217;s methods to what Frasca calls &#8220;Forum Videogames&#8221; is a notably different approach to the topic than most we&#8217;ve encountered thus far, as it embraces the adaptive, non-narrative aspects of gameplay; the approach definitely parallels Galloway&#8217;s idea of &#8220;procedural rhetoric,&#8221; but involves a higher level of direct social involvement and discussion.</p>

<p>An interesting little opinion article on CNET voices a rebuke to Apple&#8217;s marketing in the name of gaming consoles. Specifically, the writer takes issue with some comparisons made between the iPad 3 and current established &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gaming consoles, i.e. the XBOX 360 and PS3. While it may seem somewhat petty, the primary issue addressed is with the comparisons&#8217; implications that the iPad may somehow be attempting to legitimize itself in the gaming world as something more than a casual platform. Personally, I feel it rather unwise of Apple to risk annoying console fans unless they really plan on releasing something more&#8230; well.. console-y. The casual games market for portable devices is anything but lacking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must say that the <em>Wired </em>article, while informative, was done in really rather poor taste. Seventeen suicides&#8230; seventeen&#8230; purportedly out of 1 million employees&#8230; and that rate is a driving force for the article? National suicide rates are generally recorded as # per 100k population per year, so if we take the &#8220;spate of nine between March and May 2010,&#8221; (which I assume is the highest isolated rate) we end up with&#8230;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">[9/(1 Million)] * [1yr/(3mon) ] * 100000 = 3.6 yearly suicides per 100k workers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Some Wikipedia hunting reveals that as of 2010, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn">Foxconn</a> has an estimated 920,000+ employees, with 2010 bearing witness to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides#2010">estimated</a> 18 attempted suicides with 14 deaths. This is a yearly attempt rate of ~1.96 per 100,000.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The yearly suicide rate in China is somewhat debated, but the 2010 value estimated by the Center for Disease Control/Prevention is 22.3 per 100,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, during the three months of the highest suicide rate at Foxconn, the rate was only ~16% the national average in China. Although the Foxconn Suicides page linked above mentions that the Foxconn rate is likely lower in part because of lesser suicide rates for the younger adults that would make up the employee demographic, an 85% discrepancy from national average is something I&#8217;m more than comfortable with.</p>
<p>The rate of 1.96 in 2010 raises this gap to slightly over 91%. That is, Foxconn workers committed suicide at 91% lower rate per capita than other Chinese citizens.</p>
<p>So no, even though I may be willing to feel sorry for those in a more demanding and limited economic situation in general, I will not feel bad for buying hardware just because it was made in a factory. In fact, I&#8217;ll feel good about it; a little bit of the money I spend on that hardware allows someone to be employed at an admittedly horrible assembly job while their other options may only be worse.</p>
<p>So is this article enlightening about modern factory conditions at a multibillion dollar manufacturing company? Yes. Should attention be given to working conditions in nations with little worker protection and a large market for tedious manufacturing jobs? Of course. Are the suicides at Foxconn something that should be at the forefront of this attention? Not at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

Specifically, we skirted the question of whether a machine can become the operator of a game (henceforth referred to as &#8220;The Wonderfully Intrepid Question of Joyous Automation Loops,&#8221; or &#8220;TWIQJAL&#8221;†). I feel that it would be valid to posit that the answer to this question is all of yes, no, and somewhat; a definitive answer would depend on further clarification, such as the following.</p>
<p>Does the Operator &#8211; Machine relationship extend to game media other than video games?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px">If we posit that the operator machine relationship does not extend to other game media (i.e. interpersonal games not based on hardware or software programs), then the scope of situations in which an &#8220;Operator&#8221; exists, and thus the scope of situations in which TWIQJAL can be validly assessed, becomes fairly well-defined. This is the stance I am taking, as the Operator &#8211; Machine spectrum is introduced with video games in mind, and its scope was not intended to extend beyond such, as far as I can determine from the Galloway reading.</p>
<p>Must something be able to be considered &#8216;play&#8217; in order to be considered a game?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px">If a game‡ should be considered play, then it follows that TWIQJAL&#8217;s answer depends on whether a Machine can play. The answer to that, if we draw from Caillois&#8217; definition of play, is a resounding &#8220;almost, but no.&#8221; A machine programmed to play a game wouldn&#8217;t be expected to have the level of cognizance required for what most would consider a human level of &#8220;rational free will&#8221; in the matter. As such, the &#8220;game&#8221; is involuntary, and therefore not play based on Caillois&#8217; definition. I am of the viewpoint that a game must be considered play in some form to exist as a game; the entire purpose of games is to play them, and when stripped of this aspect of play, a game becomes nothing but an interactive system, no more of a &#8220;game&#8221; than any mundane electronic interface.</p>
<p>These are by no means the only questions that might be raised in assessing TWIQJAL, but the picture so far strongly favors the answer to be &#8220;no.&#8221; More specifically: &#8220;No, a machine cannot act as the Operator of a video game as presented by the Operator-Machine spectrum of analysis. A machine cannot engage in such activity in a willful manner such as is required for the activity to be considered &#8216;play&#8217; as Caillois defines it. Without the existence of play, the game ceases to be a game insofar as the applicability of the Operator-Machine relationship to it.&#8221; And they all lived happily ever after.</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Footnotes.</strong><br />
† Pronounced &#8220;twihk-jal&#8221;.<br />
‡ &#8221;Game&#8221; in the active sense of the word, i.e. &#8216;the game that takes place&#8217; as opposed to &#8216;the game sitting on the shelf&#8217;. &#8220;Video games are actions,&#8221; as Galloway says.</p>
