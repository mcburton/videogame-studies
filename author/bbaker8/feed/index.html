The first test is called the Plinkett Test and is performed by describing a character without referencing their appearance, profession, or what they do in the story. The goal of the test is to see if the character developed is more than just basic descriptions. A successful character is one that the players of the game can relate to if that is the intention of the author. Some games take a different approach depending on how the story is portrayed. The second test is called the Bechdel Test and is used as a test of female characterization. The three requirements to pass the Bachdel Test are: it has two or more women in it, they talk to each other, and about something other than a man. The point of this test is to avoid the stereotypical female roles in dramatic storytelling, and to make those females strong well-rounded characters.</p>

He names a few games that were made for relaxation such as Wild Devine, Cloud and flow. From his descriptions it seems that Wild Devine is the only game that achieves its desired effect.  Since video games require physical interface there is a fine line between causing relaxation or frustration. This brings us back to a topic that we encountered earlier in the course, casual gaming. Casual games seem like they are made to produce the sensation of relaxation in their players. With the easy interface, interruptibility, and bright mood of causal games, they let the user play at any time without time commitment or stressfulness of more hardcore games. Bogost describes them as games where the player can just zone out and relax, similar to something such as doodling on paper. I completely agree with this statement. Whether I decide to relax by playing angry birds, listening to music, or even leisurely reading a book I can block out the outside world and completely zone out of reality. I think this is the appeal of the casual gaming market to its players. A casual game, even if it is hands on, can acquire the same desired effect as any form of relaxation depending on a person’s preferences. This cannot be confused with the concept of meditation. To successfully meditate “we must reject the principle of engagement” something that video games will never be capable of doing.</p>

Most of the people who spoke in class said that they felt disturbed or uncomfortable when playing this game. Why is this happening? Many of the students in Honors 353 play First Person Shooters with good graphics, and eventually end up killing hundreds or even thousands of people. What is the difference? Why should I feel so uncomfortable playing the Torture Game when the person actually looks like a rag doll and never once shouts out in pain or makes any indication of being alive? I believe it is the plot or back-story of the game. I recently have been playing <em>Splinter Cell: Conviction</em> for the PC until my computer decided it could not run it anymore. In the beginning of the game men are trying to kill the main character and through an act of self preservation the main character successfully kills many men and also proceeds to torture others for information. Why is this okay and the Torture Game can strike up such controversy? I think the reason is the Torture Game does not have a plot. There are not cut scenes and you have no idea who the characters are in the game.  The person being tortured is not defined as a terrorist or a dictator who has committed mass genocide on his people. I am curious if that change in the game would take away the unease people experience when they play the game? Could adding that element of possible moral justification change the moods of the players? Would the controversy of this game be the same? I honestly do not think it would have gotten as bad of a reaction from the public.</p>

<p>Music can influence not only our moods but how we view things. By changing the music and the tone, something that was previously scary could become happy.</p>

<p>The opposite thing can also happen. Take the Willy Wonka trailer, add scary music and horror movie sounds. It creates the perfect base for a new thriller.</p>

<p>It is interesting how much music and tone can affect perception. Whether it is a movie or game, the music plays a large role in creating a mood that keeps its viewers/players captivated.</p>

As an economics major, sometimes I find myself comparing things I read to my major. This definitely happened during the subsection “Meltdown”. In 1982 home sales of video games were about three billion dollars, and the arcade game business was about eight billion dollars. Video game sales were extremely successful in the 1980s, but what happened? Why did this industry become reduced to a “little more than an economic crater”? Well, a basic microeconomic supply and demand graph can solve that question. The video game market was a relatively new in the 80s. As demand rose for these markets, the suppliers could not predict the large growth rate. With the possibility of making positive economic profits, many different companies entered the video game market. As stated in the text, most of these new companies had nothing innovative to offer and game revenues still fell, pushing the least effective companies out of business. It took time but the supply eventually reached the equilibrium for video games. Today there are many game companies that are effective. These are the companies that offer new and innovative games that consumers want to play with technology that does not fail. With such a fast growing market, one cannot expect the supply to match the demand at first, but the market will eventually compensate for the increase in demand to reach an equilibrium with supply.</p>
