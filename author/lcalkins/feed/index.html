He notes and expands on five characteristics of a game that determines its audience: positive or negative fiction, game usability, game interruptibility, difficulty and punishment, and the juiciness of a game. While these are all essential to the analysis of game users, I think that the author did not focus enough on the motivation of the gamers themselves.</p>
<p>I think that almost all gamers begin a game in order to escape from reality. Whether it&#8217;s boredom at work, a break from studying, enjoyment with peers, or any other reason, games ultimately provide for users an escape from their current reality. They do this by virtue of simulation. The better a game simulates an alternate reality, the more of an escape it can offer. Angry Birds and Left for Dead both provide an escape, but Left for Dead is a better simulation of an alternate reality, therefore it draws in more hardcore gamers.</p>
<p>The difference between casual and hardcore gamers then becomes the degree to which they wish to escape and the type of reality in which they wish to engage. A casual gamer who has little time to kill waiting in a doctor&#8217;s office wishes to escape the reality of waiting but only to a small degree so that other tasks can quickly be returned to. A hardcore high school gamer with few responsibilities and more available time will often wish to escape reality to a greater degree. The type of reality a player wishes to engage in is their preference for a positive or negative game world fiction.</p>

After reading through the first-readers posts, I was surprised at how many people took an attitude of informed indifference.</p>
<p>As Americans, we are on the far end of the spectrum of worldly comforts and conveniences. We expect a certain high standard for material goods. It&#8217;s not partaking in some of the conveniences that these goods and electronics afford us that I think is bad, but our culture has taken materialistic extravagance to an unprecedented level.</p>
<p>In his article, Joel Johnson definitely tries to pressure the reader into a feeling of guilt over the origins of his electronic device. While his reasoning is somewhat off &#8211; for example, focusing on the relatively low number of suicides at Foxconn &#8211; there is indeed some guilt to be placed, on him and the readers alike.</p>
<p>The working conditions are not humane. Many people work the same jobs for months at a time, forming injuries from repetitive movements. But this could easily be corrected by switching up the workers stations. The workers do not get to spend adequate time with family and friends. This is probably the largest contribution to the suicides. Humans are social creatures, living in societies, and interpersonal interaction is necessary for mental health. Additionally, we as people need purpose and goals. By allowing some form of upward movement within the factories, people would not only want to work harder but would have a better outlook for their future.</p>
<p>In short, if our culture is going to continue in it&#8217;s materialistic indulgence, then it&#8217;s our responsibility to at least be concerned about the conditions of the workers that make our products. And if small improvements can be made to those conditions, the informed people should advocate for them. Mind you, this is all easier said than done and I am just as guilty as anyone else&#8230;</p>

It all began with military funded research. Today a multitude of organizations, including the military, make use of video games and their capacity for simulation. They are used for training for air pilots in flight simulations, chemical simulations in games like Foldit, and now research money is also being put into training simulations for doctors and other medical personnel.</p>

<p>The link above is about a simulation game at Duke University&#8217;s research triangle, but accessible wirelessly from anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8221; “The purpose of this program is to practice working together. The beauty of it is that trainees can work remotely from anywhere, as long as they have a computer with internet access,” said Taekman during a recent demonstration. He’s noticed that most students take to the game rather quickly. “I can tell almost immediately who plays video games for fun,” said Taekman, as those folks usually start exploring their virtual world off the bat. &#8220;</p>
