The modding group&#8217;s actions would generally come under Galloway&#8217;s 1st category of game mods: the mod involves changing the game at the design level (changing levels and incorporating new features into the game.) This blog post for Forbes.com discusses how many recent mods have had highly successful outcomes and cites Skyrim for the PC as an example of how fans&#8217; influence on a game can elevate the game to extraordinary levels.  The blog also discusses whether modding is a threat to the &#8220;art&#8221; of videogames and suggests that the act of modding is, in fact, a form of art.  This can readily be put in Bogost&#8217;s terms as he states in his chapter on &#8220;Art&#8221; that art&#8217;s purpose is &#8220;to change, and to change us along with it&#8221; (Bogost 11.)  Clearly, modding is a form of change and can provoke new thought in game players.  Therefore, modding is most likely not the death of art, but <em>is</em> art!</p>

<p>Bogost discusses the role of videogames in inspiring empathy, and mentions that some critics maintain that gamers are not interested in playing a “feeble character,” however, he remarks that it is interesting that people are interested in watching a <em>movie</em> about a feeble character.  This relates to the similarities and differences of video games and movies; videogames offer a stronger connection between the user and the experience than movies because the user actually has some degree of control in a videogame, they are more engaged.  Thus, a player would feel more frustration with a character’s weakness in a videogame because the character’s failure is more directly connected to a failure on the part of the player, whereas in movies, there is no such connection.  This furthers the general discussion of the difference between movies and videogames as highlighted in <em>“The Gaming Situation”, </em>which asserts that viewing computer games as descendants of theatre, drama and literature is fundamentally incorrect, and remarks on the differences between videogames and more narrative situations.</p>
<p>Another interesting point that Bogost brings up is with regards to pranking and one of its earliest forms in gaming, Easter eggs.  We have discussed how Atari was very open to game developers and Bogost highlights how the idea of an Easter egg arose from how Atari would often fail to give due credit to the game creators.  Essentially, the creators are trying to inject humanity into what, at first glance, appears to be a cold and calculating piece of technology.  In some ways, this ties back to the idea of a platform study because Easter eggs often force the user to consider what happened before the game; how it was developed and where it came from.  Easter eggs can be nondiegetic actions made by the creators (such as a hidden room with credits or secret messages); they often disrupt the narrative of the game and force the player to mentally leave the game world temporarily.  Perhaps it is this jolt out of “the zone” that gives Easter eggs their power to provoke thought in the user, and thus what make them such a good prank on the game’s publishers.</p>

Your not gonna&#8217; know what hit you by the time you finish this release. Your company gonna&#8217; crumble, and you deserve it,&#8221; a statement which clearly highlights the group&#8217;s purpose.  This recent event integrates many ideas that have been discussed in class; whether we, as users of this technology, have an obligation to the workers who make it, and also whether hacking can ever be justified.  In this situation, I wouldn&#8217;t say that SwaggSec&#8217;s actions would be considered hacking in the old sense of the word (they aren&#8217;t trying to test out the system and explore its capabilities), but the actions do fit the new connotations of the term in that they seem to have more of a malicious intent.  The question remains, can their actions be justified in the name of human rights?  In this case, I would say that their methods are not justifiable for the following reason: the entire setup seems more like a way to hurt Foxconn individuals and less like a way to actually move the company towards change.</p>
