<p>With an MMO, the designer also needs to think about the large amounts of players that will try to take on quests at the same time.  Problems, like large lines to get to an NPC or waiting for a dungeon to reset itself for the next group of players, can cause players to get frustrated.  Some solutions we looked at for this problem would be having a seperately generated dungeon appear for parties or having a large area that allows multiple player to help in a quest and all recieve some sort of reward.</p>

<p>An example of a game that focuses more on the thoughts of the player then on the game&#8217;s action is <em>The Cat and the Coup</em>.  The game retells the story of Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh, through the eyes of his cat.  Moussadegh was the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran and was assassinated during a CIA engineered coup in 1953.  As the player, you take the role of the cat in helping Moussadegh progress through different rooms that retell the story of his life and his death.  The game doesn&#8217;t focus on actions but, instead, on solving puzzles and reflecting on the events that eventually led to the death of Moussadegh.  While it is hard to produce a game like this without having some personal beliefs leak through, a docu-game definitely allows the player to be more thoughtful about historical and political issues.  Ultimately, like any documentary, it is up to the player whether to trust the facts given and to agree or disagree with certain implied beliefs in docu-games.</p>

<p>One use mentioned for videogames is that they can be a form of art, or an artgame.  Since art really doesn&#8217;t have any real boundaries or definitive meaning in modern times, this means that videogames can also be considered a form of art.  While there is game art, which is art that has elements of videogames but isn&#8217;t intended for play, artgames are meant to be played first and have an artistic meaning second.  A form of art that seems to be especially prevalent in artgames is Dada, which attempts to disrupt traditional notions of social and artistic conventions.  What&#8217;s interesting about Dada artgames is that by the pure absurdness that tends to be associated with this form, Dada sometimes combines two uses for videogames: art and pranks.  An example Ian Bogost give of this odd combination of videogame uses is &#8220;Cat-Mario,&#8221; also known as &#8220;Mario from Hell.&#8221;  This game defies all conventional knowledge of videogames, especially Super Mario Bros.  Hitting &#8220;?&#8221; blocks sometimes causes a monster to attack you, spikes will randomly pop up and kill your character, and eating mushrooms will sometimes turn you into a robot and plunge you to your death.  Basically, the game makes you take the least conventional routes in order to win the game.  While this is very much an exercise in disrupting the notions of how a videogame should be played, the game is also pranking the player by luring him/her into a sense of safety before Mario meets an odd and untimely death.  Similarly, you could also say that any use of pranking in a videogame could contain elements of the Dada art form, since the action of pranking in itself is disrupting your expectations of the game and how it should be played.  An example of pranking in a videogame that disrupts the normal conventions of gameplay is where the Eternal Darkness game&#8217;s insanity effect makes the player think that their saved game has been deleted.</p>
