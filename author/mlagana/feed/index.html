This was particularly interesting, as it explores how video games can be used to help people gain a better understanding of reality and encourage critical thinking about important social and political issues.</p>
<p>Frasca provides a good example to illustrate his point that video games can promote a better understanding of reality. The example he uses is the popular <em>Sims </em>game, which allows a player to control his or her Sim or Sim family. Within this, Frasca discusses forums and modified versions of characters, such as &#8220;Dave&#8217;s Alcoholic Mother version 0.9&#8243; which allows a player to experiment with personalities and habits of characters that may be less than ideal. Alcoholism, in this case, could have a negative effect on the family. Additionally, as Frasca mentions, a player could have the ability to further modify his or her character&#8217;s habits if he or she isn&#8217;t satisfied with the level of realism displayed by her character (such as taking liquor out of a liquor cabinet instead of hiding places around a house, which is more typical of an alcoholic).</p>
<p>Also important was Frasca&#8217;s mention of video games being a tool that could be used to encourage critical thinking about current political and social issues. This idea ties heavily into material we covered in class, where we played <em>September 12</em>. <em>September 12 </em>illustrates perfectly the idea that video games can be used to offer political commentary, as a player is put in a position to kill &#8220;terrorists&#8221; in a heavily populated urban center, with civilians dressed in Islamic-style clothing interspersed. If the player kills civilians while attempting to kill a terrorist, other civilians will cry over the dead bodies of their compatriots and turn into terrorists. This means that, at any one time, a player could kill a single civilian and a single terrorist and end up <em>creating</em> three more terrorists from the grieving civilians. This is meant to highlight perceived failures (such as civilian casualties from aerial bombings) of the American War on Terror, failures that many people claim to have created more terrorists.</p>
<p>However, Frasca stops there, and will not go so far as to say that video games create social change. As <em>September 12 </em>illustrated for our section of Honors 353, video games can make us think about and debate the issues of our day, but they do not carry the kind of weight to stop bombings that kill large numbers of civilians.</p>

In the reading and in the In-Class Hosts&#8217; presentations, the issue of whether or not video games are a form of art came up. I would like to take the time to agree with Brett Baker that contemporary society will soon come to accept video games as a form of art. Additionally, I found it useful that Brett used the analogies of impressionism and jazz to justify his opinion. Indeed, as computer-based art programs (such as Adobe PhotoShop) grow in demand, and as computer graphic design becomes increasingly important in the marketing and art worlds, it seems only logical that video games will soon follow suit. Also, video games will fit well into the evolving category of modern art that places an emphasis on interaction. Interactive art is an increasingly popular subgenre of modern art, and has been very successful among art consumers worldwide. The evolution of interactive art began with the Dada movement in the 1920s and gradually progressed to include a wider consumer base and greater use of technology. One such example is <em>Wooden Mirrors</em>, which uses cameras, a computer, and overhead lighting to reproduce an image on wooden pixels. The exhibit, currently at The Open University in the United Kingdom, requires that a subject stand in front of the &#8220;mirror&#8221; while their movements are captured by cameras and reproduced by the wooden pixels in real time. Going back to video games, once the technology has improved and the current generation of &#8220;digital natives&#8221; grows up, it is my opinion that video games will become a widely accepted form of interactive art, in which consumers will play an even greater role than they do today. Evolution is inevitable.</p>
<p>Wooden Mirrors:</p>

As the smart phone market exploded with the introduction of Apple&#8217;s iPhone and Google&#8217;s Android and the introduction of the app markets, the number of games available in the &#8220;games&#8221; category of the app markets skyrocketed. These games range from simple versions of Brick Breaker to wildly popular games like Angry Birds. So what led to this casual game explosion in the smart phone app market?</p>
<p>The answer, according to PadGadget.com, are Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s extremely developer-friendly policies. Apple and Google have designed their app markets to be extremely accessible to developers seeking to design, build, and market their games. In fact, both Google and Apple have made the tools needed to design and build games easily accessible to developers. These policies, combined with the accessibility and name-recognition that comes from affiliation with the Apple and Google app markets, has led to a huge increase in the number of independent game developers being able to market their products. According to data published on PadGadget.com, indie game developers comprised 68 percent of game developers in the iOS and Android game markets in first quarter 2012. Interestingly enough, indie developers have not had such an easy time with platform development, which is dominated by big entertainment firms and extremely advanced technology that is not cheap. In short, you couldn&#8217;t design an Xbox 360 game from your home and compete with companies like Activision and Electronic Arts.</p>
<p>So, what does this indie success mean? Will this mean larger independent control over the casual smart phone gaming market and more competition? Or, will we see a consolidation of the most popular developers and the eventual monopoly over the smart phone gaming market by a select few? As of now, it doesn&#8217;t seem very clear, but it looks like Google&#8217;s and Apple&#8217;s egalitarian approach is empowering normal, independent developers to make exciting new games that are changing the way we view casual mobile games. Let&#8217;s hope it stays that way!</p>

Joel Johnson asks us to think about how much we, as consumers, are to blame for some of the horrid working conditions which plague factories that manufacture the very gadgets that have become an essential part of our daily lives.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that working conditions in some of these factories are questionable. Yet, must we feel so much guilt about it?  Can we not take two steps without being put on a guilt trip by someone who lectures us about the conditions in which our devices are made, typing from the very computer or tablet he or she criticizes others for using?  This is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Did you know that western countries are not the only countries that use smart-phones, high-end electronics, and computers? In fact, the Asian market–where many of these products originate–is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world, with a rapidly-growing consumer base.  The idea that western consumption–specifically American consumption–is the only thing that drives the massive manufacturing sector in countries like China and Thailand is unfounded.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Economic Times </em>(a publication of the <em>India Times</em>) as of August 30, 2011, the number of mobile phone users in China alone stood at 929 million people. That&#8217;s nearly <em>three times </em>the population of the United States alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See it here:</p>
<p>http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-08-30/news/29945263_1_phone-users-number-of-cell-phone-mobile-phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addressing the aspect of worker suicides, it is right that Foxconn should be concerned about them. Yet, given the relatively low number of suicides among employees, there may be a host of other factors involved that may not necessarily have to do with working conditions. Worker suicides should not be used as a starting point for discussions on working conditions – <em>working conditions </em>should be used as a starting point for discussion.</p>
<p>What do we make of this information? Should we be concerned about working conditions in these factories? Of course we should be concerned, but the idea that we should harbor some form of first-world guilt over employee suicides is silly, especially since our consumption dollars are giving people jobs that provides housing and food in a job market where many alternatives are worse. Attempting to put western consumers on a guilt trip and blaming western consumption for employee suicides is not the way to start a discussion as serious as this.</p>

In chapter one, Galloway notes that cheats and hacks are often built into games, yet they are discouraged by many as a way of taking shortcuts when others are playing according to the rules. But macros and add-ons are &#8220;tolerated, even encouraged.&#8221; (pg. 13) Galloway&#8217;s overall view regarding cheats, glitches, macros, and add-ons is that they shouldn&#8217;t necessarily be viewed as entirely hostile to the gaming experience, but rather should be viewed as <em>part of </em>the gaming experience. This topic, brought up as almost a side topic by one of the members of the presenting group devolved into a rather interesting argument regarding cheating.<br />
The traditional view is that all games should be played by the rules, video games not being an exception. However, there are those who argue that if a cheat code can be entered or a macro can be used that the developers intended that element be included in the game. Using that element would, in turn, not offend the developers&#8217; intentions for the game.</p>
<p>Perhaps, given the changing times and the changing &#8220;game landscape,&#8221; it is more appropriate for me to have an evolving, more progressive view on cheating in video games. Call me conservative if you will, but I feel as if cheating takes away from the intentions of the game (to play through each level fairly and eventually win) and can even put other, much less experienced players at a disadvantage. In many cases, the actions of  certain players, particularly in the realm of online, PC gaming, can be especially abhorrent. As former PC owner, I used to really enjoy playing Battlefield 2. Most of the time, players were honest, and servers would be quick to kick players whom they determined to be cheating, exploiting a glitch, or using a bot. Once, I would be on a server and there was a player who exploited every possible glitch, and use one part of the map as a portal to get to another part. This player was also able to exploit a glitch that allowed him or her to become invisible when standing in a particular alleyway, which would allow him or her to kill other players without detection. Players noticed this, and attempted to contact server admins for assistance in kicking the offending player. When no assistance was rendered, people began leaving the server and it stopped being fun to play on that map.</p>
<p>Although I get on my soapbox and rail against cheating, I admit that I have done it, particularly when I was the owner of an XBOX console. My reason for employing cheat codes was simple: I got stuck.<br />
This article from Forbes Magazine provides a great insight to the main reasons why people cheat and why, in some cases, it may be good for us.</p>
