In the beginning of this semester, we learned about how almost all games (not just the electronic ones) involve <em>pretending</em> to a certain extent. It&#8217;s what makes games enjoyable, whether it&#8217;s a kid running around the house and pretending to be a superhero, or one of us pretending to be in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. At the end of her post, Vianney asks if a common hardcore game could be altered into a casual one and, if so, what elements would need to change. I believe that in order to achieve such a transformation, the elements of a hardcore game that would need to be changed (or even removed) are exactly the <em>texture</em> and <em>participation.</em> The texture could be changed by replacing the visual details with simple, cartoon-like images, and the sound effects by a playful background melody. The participation could be changed by making it difficult for the player to pretend to be the main character. One way this could be done is by making a 1st person game into a 3rd person one. If you don&#8217;t believe that a hardcore game can be made into a casual game, you should play the Flash version of Portal.</p>

However, when we play a video game we usually get so lost in the gameplay that we forget to enjoy the game&#8217;s artistic side. In order to avoid arguments about what can or cannot be considered artistic, I&#8217;ll focus on music, images, and videos, all of which are very popular art forms. I&#8217;m sure everyone remembers playing Super Mario for hours&#8230; Didn&#8217;t we get to a point (usually early in the game) where we started thinking of the music merely as a background melody? Well, someone (Koji Kondo) had to get creative and come up with it! And if the theme song doesn&#8217;t sound very good, it&#8217;s probably because of the capabilities of the old Nintendo consoles. But check out this interpretation by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcKurvm_0oE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcKurvm_0oE</a></p>
<p>Even though I have never played any of the Legends of Zelda games, I can definitely appreciate the art, skills, and imagination that were necessary to create all of the characters in the game. The following image is a stunning depiction of the game. Its details and structure are (at least to me) reminiscent of some of the greatest paintings of all time.</p>
<p><a href="http://furiousfanboys.com/2011/02/the-legend-of-zelda-25th-anniversary/">http://furiousfanboys.com/2011/02/the-legend-of-zelda-25th-anniversary/</a></p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to present a short film based on the video game Portal. I believe that those who have already played the game will be able to relate to the main character. The &#8220;no escape&#8221; feeling is exactly what Portal brings to you. Of course, once you figure out how to get through a level, there is a rush of happiness, but not for too long &#8211; you move on to a bigger and more confusing chamber. This video reminds me that Portal is basically an interactive fictional movie &#8211; something I forget about while trying to make my way through the game.</p>

<p>PS: For those who have not played the game yet, I hope this serves as a brief introduction to how portals work and what you can do with them. Have fun!</p>

Some of us appreciate being able to buy tracks on iTunes instead of having to buy CDs, while others enjoy downloading music without paying anything. Since it&#8217;s very unlikely that in the 21st century, at your young age, you prefer CDs, I&#8217;ll just assume that all of us belong to one of the above 2 categories, and thus we are very happy with the MP3 format. However, most artists and production companies probably wish the MP3 format (or any other compression before it) was never created, because it allows for illegal distribution of music, and therefore it reduces their profit. It was very interesting to find out that gaming companies were (and still are) in favor of MP3. That is because it allows their platforms to play more and better audio effects with the limited amount of RAM they have. So not just greedy consumers want MP3s to stick around&#8230;<br />
2) In this chapter, Collins mentions that games drive the technologies in the area of sound. I think I agree with this. If it was up to the music production companies, the development of audio quality would have probably ended with the CDs/DVDs. They deliver great quality to the users and great profit to the producers. The gaming industry introduced the need for great quality and small size of audio files, and continues to look for ways to improve the already realistic, interactive, 3D sound effects of their games.</p>

However, if people really lean towards familiarity, how has the video game industry come this far? Most of today&#8217;s top games contain not only unfamiliar (to most) ideas, but also unrealistic ones. Casting spells, collecting magical artifacts, and killing monsters are just a few examples. One might say that the gaming industry has been incorporating these concepts into video games for a very long time, and that would be correct. But it had to start somewhere! The very first video game, <em>Pong,</em> had absolutely no violence or mystical creatures. Assuming that people prefer familiarity over exploration it would be very difficult to explain how video games have changed so drastically.</p>
<p>There is another reason it is hard for me to believe that people enjoy familiarity. Sure, spaceships may have been well known to the creators of the old-school space games, but not many of the American citizens were astronauts or had any knowledge about spaceships. Yet somehow, not long after its release, <em>Computer Space</em> became one of the most played arcade games. As BBAKER8 mentions in his post, the arcade game business was about eight billion dollars in 1982! Clearly, people were interested in something completely new, as opposed to sticking to their familiar ways of entertaining.</p>
<p>If we take one more step backwards in time, we can see that the discovering/invention of video games was itself an act of breaking away from what was familiar. <em>Pong</em> was first created on an oscilloscope, which was (and still is) only meant to display electronic signals. It took creativity and curiosity to turn this boring piece of equipment (as it&#8217;s usually thought of) into something fun. It took desire to find something unfamiliar.</p>
<p>To think about:<br />
Was &#8220;Pong&#8221; <em>invented</em> or <em>discovered?</em></p>

Multitask is a single-player online game which, as the title suggests, tests your ability to multitask. The game has absolutely no story line but it somehow manages to attract online gamers (especially the stubborn ones like myself). I enjoy playing Multitask not only because it&#8217;s entertaining but also because it tells me about my current mental state. On a good day, I&#8217;m able to survive for about 140 seconds. However, if I tried playing it during &#8220;finals week,&#8221; I would probably find myself violently pressing random keys on the keyboard while desperately trying to make it past one minute. The happier you feel with your ability to multitask, the more chaotic and stressful the game becomes. Eventually you find yourself barely keeping things under control, which I believe adds to the adrenaline. This is why I would place this game in the &#8220;ilinx&#8221; category. Of course, if you&#8217;re obsessed with high-scores, and if you enjoy competing against yourself, this game could also be in the &#8220;agón&#8221; category. Besides testing your multitasking skills, I believe that this game is also capable of <em>improving</em> them. Every part of the game is simple enough so that &#8220;this is too confusing&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m not a gamer&#8221; are not excuses for low scores. The only acceptable excuse is that your brain isn&#8217;t able to process and react to multiple pieces of information <em>yet.</em> However, by playing Multitask more, I believe that you can train your brain to perform multiple tasks at once. Perhaps you&#8217;ll even be able to juggle with 5 balls, just like you&#8217;ve always wanted!</p>

<p>To think about:<br />
Caillois says that no profit can be gained by games. It is believed that intellectuality is even more valuable than wealth. If you believe that a certain game (not necessarily this one) improves your brain&#8217;s functionality or teaches you something, would you even label it a &#8220;game&#8221;? Would Caillois?</p>
