Until I played Flight to Freedom rarely had I thought about the everyday hardships of slavery and how decision to escape would affect the life of a slave. I rarely considered what I would do without an education to help guide me through my decision making processes. But all these things and more are highlighted when Frasca asks us to take Boalian approach to games as is taken in theater. However, one must be careful with such an approach when it comes to learning about history (as Frasca states with an Anne Frank example). Because of the role that video games play in shaping a player&#8217;s sense of reality through immersion it is critical that video games not assume the role of documentary as espoused by Raessens. As Raessens quotes in his article, &#8220; Documentary computer games are capable of opening the area of the historical documentary to a large audience and may become very popular judging from the enthusiasm with which computer games generally are played and discussed&#8221;. Because of the educational effect&#8221; video games can have it is important not to fill them with inaccuracies. If a video games about the JFK assassination is the only place a fourteen year-old learns about this tragedy in our country&#8217;s history let it not be an inaccurate game. Because video games can assume the role of documentary games, when they do, they should be accurate.</p>

Bogost states that videogames usually place us in roles that let us fulfill power fantasies by taking on powerful roles. However, he then states that this is not always the case. Every once in while a game will place the player in role of weakness. He gives examples of games such as Darfur is Dying and E.T. Both are games where the character is on who is helpless during the sequence and thus the player can experience empathy for them. Whether going to fetch water or running from FBI agents Bogost purports that a vantage point of weakness is what allows one to empathize with the games character or subject matter. I would venture to stretch this claim further.</p>
<p>At times a role of weakness is not necessary to cause the player to empathize with the character or subject matter. For example, when you play Madden there&#8217;s a mode known as Superstar mode. In Superstar mode you start as a rookie at the combine who is looking to play in the National Football League. You get drafted and work your way through an NFL career. The more work you put into training, practices, and working out the better your character becomes in the game. By requiring that players put in hours of practice and training in order to become elite NFL stars the makers of Madden make it possible for a player to empathize with the player in the actual NFL and the hard work it takes them to do well at what they do. So in causing a player to spend a similar amount of time investing in the end product the makers of Madden generate empathy from those who play the game. This is another that videogames cause us to walk in the shoes of others.</p>

Because of the fiction, interruptibility, difficult and punishment, and juiceness of casual games, they often leave gamers transfixed. Because gamers feel as if they can stop playing at anytime they do not mind playing &#8220;just one more level&#8221;. However, because casual games are difficult but not too difficult a gamer like myself feels like he or she can complete the game rather quickly. As is evidenced by sites like addictingames.com and games on that site like <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/action-games/bloons.jsp">http://www.addictinggames.com/action-games/bloons.jsp</a>. This being said the transfixion that video games leave gamers in are not trances of a vegetative-like state but rather trances where neutron circuits (Hotz). In a study published by the Wall Street Journal Robert Lee Hotz lets informs us that, &#8220;Almost any computer game appears to boost a child&#8217;s creativity, researchers at Michigan State University&#8217;s Children and Technology Project reported in November&#8221;. Video games make us smarter.</p>

However, if we take on this mentality of gathering as much information as possible regarding the history of our games and technology why not take on the same mentality regarding our automobiles, our furniture, our stationery and our clothing? It is borderline impossible and may be even unreasonable to expect to educate oneself on all of one’s purchases even though doing so would probably result in more fair trade practices as well as better conditions for others.  The more reasonable approach I believe is to educate those workers who are exploited and to make an example of companies engaged such practices by taking their business down through legislation and lawsuits.</p>

This will continue to stay this way because of what each genre sets out to accomplish. Games can not be narratives because of the original intent. Games are played with a goal in mind. When I play Oregon Trail or Tetris I have a specified goal in mind to accomplish. In Oregon Trail the goal is to get a group of people to a settlement in the West successfully. In Tetris the goal is to line up the blocks so they fit together.  Neither of these had in mind a goal of developing a plot nor does either of them need plot development in order to set this goal as the objective of the game. When I play Oregon Trail my goal is not to develop the characters in the game but rather to transport them. As Aarseth pointed out games are games and artistic elements are merely supports for the gameplay. Oregon Trail is still Oregon Trail without a narrative. Tetris is still tetris without a narrative. Games are measured on accomplishments. Narratives are not. The pursuit of an accomplishment figures into the identity of a game. There is pursuit of a goal every time one plays a game. Accomplishments, however, are not integral to the success or failure of a narrative or story. Because the intent of narratives and games are different the two genres will remain in their respective realms and attempts to merge the two will find little success.</p>
