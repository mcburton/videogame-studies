<p>Tuesdays class left many of us discussing the concept of Kitsch in relation to videogames. I was pretty puzzled when reading this portion of the text, wondering if this was truly a category worthy of being a chapter. My group posed the question; Can hardware be classified as Kitsch?</p>
<p>Kitsch is classified as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Art, objects, or design considered to be in poor taste because of excessive garishness or sentimentality, but sometimes appreciated in an ironic or knowing way. The lava lamp is an example of sixties kitsch</li>
<li>Excessively garish or sentimental art; usually considered in bad taste</li>
<li>Kitsch is a form of <a title="Visual art" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_art">art</a> that is considered an inferior, <a title="Taste (sociology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_(sociology)">tasteless</a> copy of an extant style of art or a worthless imitation of art of recognized value</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe I have found the answer to that question.</p>
<p>There have been a variety of game hardware systems that I would consider being Kitsch. I remember seeing a game console when I was younger that looked like a Nintendo 64 controller but was a whole system that connected to the television. This system contained a variety of games. While I could not track this down, this concept of other game systems that are counterfeit can be seen here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smosh.com/smosh-pit/photos/16-ridiculous-knock-game-consoles">http://www.smosh.com/smosh-pit/photos/16-ridiculous-knock-game-consoles</a></p>
<p>Whether it be the black market game console, or a multipack of technically legal but cheaply reproduced Tetris and such games, I feel that these concepts and consoles are Kitsch. This hardware would fall under the classification of imitation and inferior.</p>

</em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/playdrawsomething">http://www.facebook.com/playdrawsomething</a></p>
<p>This is a game that I am currently playing on my iPhone, and can be played on other platforms such as Android or on Facebook. The game allows you to challenge your friends by drawing a word while they attempt to guess. You can have multiple games going at a time, and each turn takes merely seconds. It is a fast paced, casual game… or so I thought. The reason for mentioning this game is because of the structure that is underlying. At first, it appears that playing consists of only drawing and guessing. Each time a drawing is guessed correctly, both players earn points determined by the difficulty of the word. With these points you are able to purchase more colors to add to your personal palette. It is this particular feature that intrigues me.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the game?<br />
–To obtain points.<br />
–To obtain colors.<br />
–To “play.”</p>
<p>I had been playing for a while and I noticed that I had a significant amount of points. After clicking around I discovered that while in game play (drawing) is where you choose to buy additional colors, not in the settings menu. This is an interesting design choice by the creator of the game. Playing this game and experiencing this specific style of menu interface made me aware of my interactions with the menu system, where I would normally just play without thinking.</p>
<p>As we have seen from the games played in class, some games have a distinct menu system while others place the player in the midst of the action and just “go.” This leads me to believe that it may be easier to pick up and go with games that have a menu that allows for start/stop/save/pause verses a game with predetermined checkpoints or a less clear structure. I will continue to consider the menu style of games as I play them, and I encourage you to do the same.</p>

Most prominent is the advancement of the technology that delivers sound to the player of the videogame. This advancement is affected by a variety of issues. Sound generation has been a limiter for games in the past, as the sounds were created on the console itself. A transition occurred towards recorded sounds due to the limitations of sound generating technology. Once recorded sounds were being used, the issue of memory space was once again limiting the game. As speaker technology advanced, the use of surround sound increased. All of these factors remain dependent on one another. Speaker technology, a force outside of the realm of the videogame or the console, determined what sounds would be incorporated into the game. The memory of the game disk then determined what sounds would be included, while the limitation of the consoles processing power determined how many sounds could be played at once. What could be different?</p>
<p>Role Playing (video)Games represent a new spectrum of sound development for videogames. The realistic elements of some RPG’s require realistic sounds, aside from the unrealistic, aesthetically focused, sounds associated with other videogames. Sounds began to focus on these realistic elements, and they continued to develop in that spectrum. Is it possible that a new area of sound emerge? With a new game, console, or development of speakers, I feel that the sounds present in videogames could transform again. This wouldn’t need to affect all videogames; it could only develop for a limited focus. But what would that new focus be?</p>
<p>I challenge everyone to think about a new sound presence.</p>

Building off of the rear view mirror concept- there is nothing “new” to videogames. The perception of new is there, but that is not the reality. When asking the class: “have you performed a new motion on the Wii-mote?” The answer by all was “no”. The Wii was a wonderful innovation to the input aspect of the video game; however the software component remains the same- stuck in the confines of what is already in use (familiar). Video games have not broken the boundaries of new motion.</p>
<p>The input and software component go hand in hand. There needs to be a new type of video game requiring a new type of input. During the in class video, it was revealed that someone invented the joystick. This was invented to fly the spaceship with more precision than existing input devices. This can be seen as Guitar Hero set the foundation for the software side of a game requiring a new input device. At first it was applied to a guitar. Soon after, drums and other instruments were tapered into input devices for the existing software. The two are complimentary, and need to advance together.</p>
<p>When thinking of video games, I immediately think of home consoles. Arcades, however, possessed games with other forms of input. Dance Dance Revolution is an example of this. A beat pad for your feet is the primary input device. For fun, I suggest using a home console beat pad on other games. I used to jump around like a fool playing fighting games using the beat pad as the input device. It is fun… It is play.</p>

In class we discussed the issue of Play not having a universal definition. As of now, Play appears to be the primary reason for videogames. As we continue through the course, we will begin discussing other uses for videogames. The attached video outlines real life implementation of videogames as learning tools for school. The videogames presented go above and beyond animated math problems and into a realm of virtual reality. Using a videogame to recreate a human patient as practicing medical students examine him is only one application. The line is becoming blurred between virtual reality and videogame.</p>
<p>It is assumed that those playing the videogames are going to learn and be able to replicate their newly acquired skills outside of the videogame. My main concern is that there is still a residual presence of videogame, existing outside of reality, in the new learning modules. The implication of this is the creation of a separation from the learning experience and real life implementation of what was learned. In the setting of the game, one may respond differently than in real life. This would occur because we cannot control ourselves, meaning our chemical and emotional balance. An adrenalin rush is not in our control, and may not be present in the game setting. Other internal variables change the way we perceive and react to information. Because of the possibility of this occurrence, I would not want to rely on videogames as a primary teaching method. I do not mean to discredit the field of videogames entirely, because I do recognize their value.</p>
