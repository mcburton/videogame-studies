Ken gave a very quick but detailed presentation on what tools are useful for a narrative game designer. Some points that particularly stood out to me were the ideas of tactibility and a player’s emotional response to a game.</p>
<p>The topic of tactibility came up when discussing the importance of the quality of objects one uses in a narrative game. Narrative games are dense in their use of dialogue. Objects intentionally placed to interact with characters can give the player information in a more interactive or tactile way. An example of this was a worn train ticket. Rolston showed this image in his presentation and it sparked my interest. I wondered what are some things that a train ticket could say better than a dialogue among characters or the narrator and the player. A train ticket could tell the player, where they’re going or have been, or where some one else in the story has been or is going. What are other objects that can speak for themselves? Would an engraved ring or a planner do the same?</p>
<p>A connection I did not expect to make with narrative games is their attentiveness to the player’s emotional experience. Take the train ticket for example, what if the train ticket revealed that a loved one in the story planned to escape or runaway. This would most likely evoke a sense of sadness or anger due to betrayal; nonetheless the tactile object evoked a emotional response. Similarly Rolston discussed that fonts evoke different emotions as well. Fonts can take the player into a different time period and then evoke a sense of emotion through different perceptions. I found this idea to parallel our past discussion in regards to how music in games evoke an emotional response. I think fonts evoking a sense of emotion in a player is an idea we do not consciously notice but is a very powerful one. The emotions a font stirs up are not only valuable in narrative games but have value in other games as it could potentially sustain the mood of a game even while the player navigates menus or opening scenes. Are there other non-diegetic elements that purposefully evoke a subconscious emotional response from the player?</p>

At first glace I was intrigued by Bogost’s title, Texture, for the chapter. I really did not know what to expect given that in my mind texture meant tactile, something one touches, and in videogames you only touch the controller or the keys on a computer. It seemed odd that there would be anything else to add in terms of texture. After reading the chapter I realized that videogames create texture in a visual way with graphics and through the use of music and sound effects. Yet, what made me ponder further was this idea of user participation, Bogost’s says that participation is required in videogames. I think the participation he speaks of is more than the obvious participation as a player but in fact a participation of buying into what is actually being played. To some degree this reminds me of the ideas we have discussed in regards to film. In film an actor rarely breaks the fourth wall by speaking to the audience. Now personally when the fourth wall is broken it most often brings me in further to the movie given that I am being confronted by the actor and usually know something that another character may not know. I find that texture in fact does the same. Hence when a gamer feels the rumble of another car crashing into him in a race he does not just see it but feels it as well. To further the discussion in texture I would ask if the rumble in videogames is similar to that of 3D effects in film, why or why not?</p>
<p>Another note I would like to make is in regards to the chapter on Throwaways. Already having discussed casual games in class I found the Bogost added to the conversation by his three classifications of casual: indifferent, spontaneous or fleeting. More specifically, I thought that he makes a good point that casual games involve more total play time than ‘hardcore’ games and that these games almost need to resemble another game in order to more easily be picked up and played.  Thus, I’d like to pose the question, could a common ‘hardcore’ game be altered into a casual game? If so, what elements specifically would need to change? If not, why?</p>

Some of the focal points discussed in class and in the posts were the level of difficulty of games, the interruptibility of games and the overall juiciness of games.</p>
<p>In terms of preferring a game to be too easy or too difficult, according to the survey taken in class the majority of the class found that a game being too easy was worse than a game being too difficult. I myself, although not an avid gamer, completely disagree. I think that if a game is too easy, you and your level of gaming skills may be what prevent you from playing. I think this definitely speaks to how much weight a gamer feels the usability of the game should have. However, if a game is too difficult, the game itself is what prevents you from playing. I also think the purpose of why one plays factors into whether the degree of difficulty is of a significant importance. Since my personal goal of playing games is to be distracted for a short period of time and then return to the real world, a game being too easy does not deter from playing me all that much.</p>
<p>What I have realized is that the above truly relates to the interruptibility and the juiciness of the game. Interruptiblity as discussed in class pertains to how easy it is to stop and start a game. Given that my own goal is to quickly get distracted from the world for a short period of time, interruptibility is an important factor. Similarly when playing the two casual games infront of the class we see that the juiciness helps in whether or not one desires to interrupt the game. I noticed that juiciness may in fact have a correlation to the flow or getting into the zone of a game.  The author of the blog <em>Escape from Reality in Virtual Simulation</em> said, “I think that almost all gamers begin a game in order to escape from reality…The better a game simulates an alternate reality, the more of an escape it can offer. Angry Birds and Left for Dead both provide an escape, but Left for Dead is a better simulation of an alternate reality, therefore it draws in more hardcore gamers.” Hence I relate this idea of good simulation to our discussion on juiciness. Yes, juiciness is described as excessive positive feedback but if you are looking for an alternate world and the graphics progressively feel more and more like a virtual reality, do graphics not then serve as a positive feedback? Perhaps you may argue that the fiction valence is more appropriately connected? I would question then where does the argument hold when one considers the players autonomy to choose as the this author says, “The type of reality a player wishes to engage in is their preference for a positive or negative game world fiction.”?</p>

<p>Above is a quick and interactive &#8220;slide show&#8221; about minor and major key music. It illustrates with the use of a violin what we discussed in class. At the end it makes the note that minor key music often mimics the human voice&#8217;s moan or sigh. Since moans and sighs are related to our familiar human expression of sadness, we would perceive this music as sad.  This made me think back to the underground Mario music. Does is sound like anything familiar to you? Can you relate it to a human body expression of anxiousness? I thought it maybe related to the human heartbeat and the repetitiveness followed by a pause could be seen as the expression of a heart stopping or shortness of breath due to fear.</p>

I do not play a lot of video games but I have participated in some discussions centered on video games. The most popular of them all seems to be the question of violent video games and their effects on the human player. Now, I have heard different arguments for both sides, both from my peers and different professors, yet, I have never heard any sort of point made in regards to the origins of video games. I find it highly interesting that the root of video games was within our military agency. I also found it interesting that the first hackers could be considered as video game explorers. With these two concepts it seems that the argument that gives them a negative connotation is that the skills or characteristics of violent video games and hackers were taken too far. When and why did people get uncomfortable with either issue? What’s the goal of a hacker today? Are they still participating in the whimsical activity of divergent thinking? If not, has it been replaced with another goal or vice? These are just some of the questions that I thought about early on in the chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In playing <em>Asteroids</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em> I also began to think about the diegetic element of scenery in which games are placed.  The chapter discussed the importance of the Sci-fi genre and its solidification of a prime youth genre with the release of the Star Wars movie. But I wonder if games like <em>Asteroids</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em>, that I assume mimic the early games like <em>Spacewars </em>or <em>Battlezone</em>, were not set in Space but on Earth with people instead of aliens and a cop car instead of a spaceship, would the issue of video game violence been raised sooner? Even though, if violence is the main concern, one might expect the violent act of shooting aliens to be one of uproar as well early on in the video game world.</p>
