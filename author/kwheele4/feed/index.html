<p>This article takes an interesting look at User Interfaces in different games.  Similar to the Galloway reading, the author of this article (Marcus Andrews) uses a quartered categorization system for interfaces in games.  His two axes are that of diegetic and non-diegetic interfaces (exists in the game world or not) and 3D representation (is the interface viewed in 3D by the player, whether or not it is in the actual game world).  He takes a look at some specific games including Dead Space and Far Cry 2, examines which elements of the games show what type of interface, and points out the benefits and drawbacks of each.  This article provides a more specific look at the diegetic-nondiegetic conversation we had in class.</p>
