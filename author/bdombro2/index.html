The ones that stuck out most to me were Ken Rolston’s key note presentation, Laura Pecker’s workshop; Improvisational Story Telling for Game Development, and Keaven Freeman’s workshop; Quest Crafting: Maximizing Impact without a Wall of Text. Ken’s speech was really interesting and I never thought that so much about game writing can be learned from table top and paper game storytelling and overall design. As a want to be Game Designer I found that he had a lot of really good points for writing story for RPG’s, which as he said is the hardest genre of game to write for. I was a little disappointed that his presentation and all the others that I attended focused on writing for the genre of RPG or MMORPG. It would have been nice to get a taste of how writing may be different when you are working with  designing a Strategy game, First Person Shooter, Point and Click adventure, etc.</p>
<p>	What I loved so much about Laura Pecker’s workshop was that it was fun, and really helped me find my inner creativity. For those of you who did not attend we did small group collective story telling exercises that focused on speed and unpredictability. She said that whenever you find yourself stuck in a rut with your plot or a character, to try out one of these exercises to see what possibilities you can come up with.</p>
<p>	Keaven Freeman’s workshop was about designing quests that are fairly deep and complex, and how to streamline events and dialogue so that you do not bore the player with walls of text explaining what they must do. He said that the best way to say things about your game world or characters is to not say it at all. Instead of telling a player that a character does this or that, show them and have other characters in the world react and talk about things to give the player a hint without spilling the beans in front of  them outright. This was a point also made by Seamus Sullivan in his presentation on good dialogue. In all I felt that I learned a lot about game and character design,  tools to good storytelling and dialogue, writer to player relations, and a bunch about what exactly it means to be a writer or designer for a game. </p>

<p>The game tried to label itself not as a game but as a simulation, that would shed light and insight and inspire inquiry into the subject of &#8220;the war on terror&#8221;. It claims that because one does not win or lose, only choose to shoot or not to shoot, that September 12th is not a game. Based on our understanding of diegetic and nondiegetic acts of games we know through the players interactions with it that this really is a game. We have played games before where the player does not really win or lose; Echo Bazaar, The Torture Game, and Dys4ia. The lack of the threat of loss or reward of victory does not strip September 12th of its label as a game, but what about its self proclaimed rank of &#8216;simulation&#8217;?</p>
<p>Simulation is defined as; the act of imitating the behavior of some situation or some process by means of something suitably analogous. Clearly the creators of September 12th are trying to share their opinions and thoughts on US foreign policy and Military Intervention around the world, particularly regarding post 9-11 terrorism. This game is in no way a suitably analogous process to that of the complexity of the side effects and backlash of civilian casualties to missile strikes against insurgent populations. I&#8217;m not trying to share my views on this subject one way or another, but I do strongly believe that September 12th does not deserve the title of &#8216;simulation&#8217;. The game vastly over simplifies a highly complex subject matter that cannot be accurately replicated with such simple tools. Saying September 12th &#8216;simulates&#8217; the war on terror is like saying Mario Kart simulates NASCAR or Spore simulates evolution and natural selection. It does create a  very basic sense of empathy and understanding of people who may be living in such situations, but really this game isn&#8217;t realistic or accurate enough to truly be called a simulation.</p>

We then started talking about the differences between casual and hardcore games, and gamers. We often identified hardcore games usually as console or PC games that really immerse the player for hours at a time, and require a lot more time being put into it. We labeled casual games as more interrupt-able and less time consuming. This emphasis on time got me thinking. Sure you may only play Bubble Spinner, Tetris, or Angry Birds for a few minutes at a time, but often you play them more than once throughout the day and more often on a daily basis than hardcore games. If someone plays 10 minutes of a game on their smart phone 5 times a day every day that&#8217;s 6 hours a week ( if my math is right). I feel that if you played 6 hours of Angry Birds a week, that would make you a hardcore Angry Bird-er. So what I&#8217;m trying to get at is perhaps we should look differently at the element of time of game play when considering a game or gamer a hardcore or casual game. If you put the same amount of time into a *casual* mobile phone game as someone does in a *hardcore* game in  one week; perhaps you should reconsider your label as a casual gamer. </p>

It got me thinking about one thing though… Is the music part of the game, or are game just part of the music. I know that’s poorly worded so I will elaborate. Game music has changed over the years from the bleeps and bloops of Pong to the wonderful rich scores of games like Halo and Oblivion. But also music in general has changed a lot in its respective history, from renaissance to classical and romantic to modern.  So is this change we are seeing in game music, is it coming from changes in games in general or from changes in music or both? Game music is not quite like the soundtrack to a movie or a new album released by a musical artist, it has its own methods, purposes, and functions. So I think what I am trying to say is: Is the development of game music as a medium a change more in the realm of gaming or in the realm of music?</p>

These games were first developed by the hackers who were exploring the possibilities of Computer capabilities at the time. With thoughts going back to our first week of class on what is fun, I found myself wondering what is was about these very basic first computer games that people found fun? Was it in physically interacting with the device? Was it seeing an output from the device respond to the players input? Was it in seeing the visual display of the computer to create various images? I do not think so, because these initial ‘game developers’ had put in so much time and work with these machines that they knew many of their capabilities and would not be entertained by the same old thing they had seen before. I believe their entertainment came from the thematic tone created by the combination of all of the computer aspects coming together to be called a game. It was the sense of doing something other than math and calculations with a computer. It was not the shapes that made up the space ships or lasers, or the input buttons that caused the game to be fun; but the sense that you were playing a game. I believe it was the sense that you are shooting space ship, aliens, or asteroids; the sort of story or template placed over the non-diegetic computer processes that entertained the players of these first video games. Even now in the present I feel it is the sense of play created by a game itself, which makes it a game.</p>
