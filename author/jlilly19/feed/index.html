<p style="margin-top: 10px">The reading this week, titled &#8220;Interactive Fiction,&#8221; discussed what encompasses Interactive Fiction. It involves a text-based role playing game in which you can give a variety of different commands (such as touch, smell, exit, go north, etc.) to the player. You can explore the world through using these various commands.</p>
<p>For instance, in the game Bronze you set in the scene of a medieval castle. You can explore different rooms in the castle by going north, south, east or west. The game starts out by telling you about a &#8220;Beast,&#8221; with whom you are well acquainted. You can explore various rooms in the castle, such as the State Rooms, the kitchen, the Tower, and many others.</p>
<p>What is interesting about this game is that for the player to become aware of their digital world they must actively look, smell, take, or perform some other action. Items can also be obtained or manipulated within a given space (Montfort defines <em>rooms</em> vs <em>locations</em> and <em>areas</em>). So within a particular room there can be a sword, shield, or spear that the player can use to help them complete the game. Montfort defines rooms as &#8220;a simulated place from which a certain set of elements in the IF world can be sensed, manipulated, or otherwise acted upon.&#8221;</p>
<p>These games in a way achieve more than the high resolution HD graphics of many games today. Because the only thing visible to the player is the text, it leaves the appearance of the digital world up to the imagination of the gamer. No two people are going to mentally construct the castle in Bronze the same way. In this respect, then, do games like Bronze achieve better visuals than games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 3? After all, the images the human imagination produces is hard to compete with.. What is more realistic: a room digitally constructed by programmers or one produced by the human imagination?</p>

<div></div>
<p style="margin-top: 10px">In class yesterday, we discussed games that portray historical events, such as the JFK shooting. Video games like <em>JFK Reloaded</em> accurately portray an event in the recent past. Because we are put in Lee Harvey Oswald&#8217;s shoes in the video game, we have the ability to reenact his actions on that fateful day. We can point the gun, look down the sight, and choose where and when to fire. This is different than if we watched a documentary on the JFK shooting, even if we viewed it from the perspective of Oswald.</p>
<p>Compare this to the movie <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, which we saw in class back in February. The most climatic moment of the movie is when Buffalo Bill stalks Clarice Starling. The camera terrifyingly switches to the serial killer&#8217;s view with his night goggles on. This puts us in the shoes of a cold-blooded killer. We don&#8217;t have control of the killer as we do in <em>JFK Reloaded</em>. He cocks his revolver and swipes in an attempt to grab Starling on his own.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, do we still feel like we are somehow responsible for the attempted death of Starling? We were not directly involved in her attempted murder, but the movie still produces the effect of putting us inside the mind of a serial killer. In this way, it accomplishes the same goal as <em>JFK Reloaded</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we feel like we&#8217;re in a first-person shooter in the movie. We can see Buffalo Bill&#8217;s hands and the gun in his hand. If a video game was made of <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, in which we played Buffalo Bill, what would the goal of the game be? For Starling to kill us or to successfully murder the rookie FBI agent? Would we be accurately portraying the movie (as it exists in history) if we allowed Sterling to kill Buffalo Bill?</p>
<p>I argue that for this to be a playable and successful video game, it would need to model <em>Flight to Freedom</em>. Different choices would be made available to the player (Buffalo Bill) throughout the game, but the final outcome would be the same. In this case, it would be death. But as in <em>Flight to Freedom</em>, badges, trust, and items could be acquired that could alter the storyline of the game. However, to be faithful to the movie and its writers, the inevitable end would not change.</p>

<div></div>
<p style="margin-top: 10px">A recent article on Tim Schafer quotes him saying that video games need to be funnier.</p>
<p><a title="Video Games Should Be Funnier, says Tim Schafer" href="http://kotaku.com/5895770/video-games-should-be-funnier-says-tim-schafer/">http://kotaku.com/5895770/video-games-should-be-funnier-says-tim-schafer/</a></p>
<p>He is quoted as saying, &#8220;If the game is not funny, then you&#8217;re missing something.&#8221; The most recent game that he&#8217;s developed, <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, caters specifically to this need. It is a text-based game that features a pirate named Guybrush Threepwood as the main character. The game is centered around the player attempting to solve puzzles and riddles, but with a funny spin-off.</p>
<p>In one part of the game, Guybrush falls in love with Governor Elaine Marley. Schafer was given the task of writing the love scene. But in five lines.</p>
<p>Phrases like &#8220;plunder bunny&#8221; and &#8220;honey pumpkin&#8221; tell us that this isn&#8217;t supposed to be taken seriously.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPZ2F5MCNrs">Monkey Island Remake &#8211; Guybrush &amp; Elaine </a></p>
<p>I think that this element of humor could be added to Bogost&#8217;s chapter on<em> Relaxation</em>. He mentions the idea that video games should allow a player to &#8220;lean back.&#8221; What better way to lean back and have some fun than to add a bit of humor into a game? It would have served Bogost well to at least mention this in his chapter on <em>Relaxation</em>. Humor keeps the player interested. It also blurs the line between a gamer being active and passive. If you add too much humor, how much is the player really engaged in the video game? If too little, will the gamer will get bored and walk away?</p>
<p>So how can video game designers successfully incorporate humor into their games?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 10px">In the reading titled &#8220;Casual Revolution,&#8221; the author, Jesper Juul, talks about the difference between &#8220;casual&#8221; gaming and &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gaming. The casual gamer isn&#8217;t looking to get engrossed in a video game with advanced graphics and a complex system of controls. They&#8217;re looking to just have some fun. Whether they need to take a break from homework or just have some fun with friends on a Saturday night, these gamers don&#8217;t need to be won over by stunning gameplay or a thrilling storyline. On the other hand, hardcore gamers take playing video games very seriously. According to the article, they should &#8220;spend as<br />
much time as possible, play as difficult games as possible, play games at<br />
the expense of everything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are the typical stereotypes of casual and hardcore gamers, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="http://samplereality.com/gmu/hnrs353-001/files/2012/03/LEGO_Star_Wars_Video_Game.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-709" src="http://samplereality.com/gmu/hnrs353-001/files/2012/03/LEGO_Star_Wars_Video_Game.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>An example that comes to mind for casual video games is <em>Lego Star Wars</em> for the Nintendo Wii. In the game itself, it has an emotionally positive element to it. The low graphics and fun storyline make it enjoyable for all ages. There are multiple instances in the game where characters fall down, play jokes on each other, and bump into doors, which adds to the less-serious atmosphere of the game. The game is also easy to learn how to play within a few minutes on the Wii. There are only four main components that a user needs to know to complete the game: jump, attack, toggle characters, and use items. Juiciness of the game includes getting over 1 million coins, completing objectives, and unlocking new content. The interruptibility of the game lags, however, as the user must reach a checkpoint before they can save. However, the straightforwardness of the game allows the user to reach checkpoints relatively easily. Finally, the punishments in the game are very low. A user starts out with four hearts, and each hit by an opponent eliminates one of these hearts. When all four hearts are depleted, the user is destroyed, but the game still continues (though you lose all your coins). So basically there is no possible way to lose the game.</p>

<div></div>
<p style="margin-top: 10px">What stood out to me from class on Tuesday was the argument that Joel Johnson made in the on Wired.com</p>
<p>First off, he exhibited poor <em>logos</em>. The nets that prevented workers from jumping from the top of the factory was the main focus of his article. But this showed poor logic.  Is this really the most important information about the Foxconn factories? 17 suicides in 5 years is nothing compared to college student suicide rates, as he says himself in the article. If this is the case, then why highlight the sparse number of self-inflicted deaths in the piece? He himself says: <em>&#8220;That 17 people have committed suicide at Foxconn is a tragedy. But in fact, the suicide rate at Foxconn’s Shenzhen plant remains below <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suiciderates/en/">national averages</a> for both rural and urban China, a bleak but unassailable fact that does much to exonerate the conditions at Foxconn and absolutely nothing to bring those 17 people back.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Why bring make the nets that prevent these suicides the main feature of the article? It just doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>Secondly, his <em>pathos</em> argument is poor. He tries to guilt trip Apple users into feeling bad for the 17 deaths in Foxconn. Though those deaths are tragic, we are not responsible for them. The workers in Foxconn are not throwing themselves off rooftops left and right. The less than ideal living conditions are a valid point that he makes though, as the workers are not much better off than college students.</p>
<p>Thirdly, his<em> ethos</em> as a writer is believable because he is a writer for Gizmodo.com and conducted thorough interviews. The details about the living conditions, long hours, and the repetitive work all show that he was meticulous in his reporting.</p>
