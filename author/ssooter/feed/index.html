<p>MC Frontalot (and to a similar extent, the video editor Jason Scott) demonstrates an understanding of what makes the text adventure so very fun.</p>
<p>Which is sort of the odd thing, text adventures aren&#8217;t really gone, they&#8217;ve just had to adapt to a changing world. Unfortunately, the only game of the type I can readily come up with an example for has lewd content. Originally titled Softporn Adventure, Leisure Suit Larry was a &#8220;classic&#8221; text adventure of the time, and several games later it has had two unsuccessful (pornographic games don&#8217;t sell well) outings in 3D, with both traditional text adventure elements and the introduction of coordination tests. Who knew watching X-play back when it was on techTV could come in handy. Interestingly, according to wikipedia, the latest game in the series features no nudity or explicit sexual situations.</p>
<p>After that little sidetrack, let&#8217;s get back to the point.</p>
<p>Interactive Fiction is mostly worth noting as, while not the first form of video game, it was the most prolific for a long period of time, and helped flesh out the concept of a video game, as more than just a coordination test, a la Pac Man; Asteroids; etc. This bleed-back can be seen as early as the game Sinistar. Compare:<br />
Asteroids: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZfsnA7dAHI<br />
Sinistar: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcyBtVwAsfg &#8211; Please watch Sinistar with SOUND</p>
<p>What I am arguing here is that interactive fiction not only made puzzling a part of video games, but also made story an integral function. Sinistar is not merely a particularly powerful and frustrating opponent, but also an entity. He has a philosophy: http://onastick.net/drew/sinistar/ yet ultimately the gameplay is functionally on par with that of Asteroids.</p>
<p>He is also beyond terrifying in a video-game concept. Dwarfing your ship, Sinistar is an organic entity with a single-minded purpose, being to destroy you, and he is faster than you. Fortunately, you have ranged weapons he lacks, and his cornering could use some work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honestly not sure what else I can say about Interactive Fiction. It&#8217;s another genre of gaming, an old genre that many feel is dead. I almost feel like they&#8217;re more interesting for their narrative choices and incomprehensible methodology than as a game.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a few gems from interactive fiction:<br />
One of the King&#8217;s Quest games allowed you to pick locks, and become proficient at it. You could also pick your nose. If you were below a certain skill level, you would jam the lockpick up your nose and into your brain, killing you instantly. Above that level, you could practice your lockpicking skill by picking your nose. &#8220;Your Nose Is Now Open&#8221;</p>
<p>Another game had you meet a dragon, as many games did.<br />
&gt;Kill Dragon<br />
   What with, your bare hands?<br />
&gt;Yes<br />
Congratulations! You killed a dragon! Ain&#8217;t that something? ~(this line is paraphrased)</p>

<p>Which is to say, because videogames can simulate, this is what they should be used for. This If A, Then B mindset is sort of limiting.</p>
<p>It makes sense on the face &#8211; videogames are a distinct medium, and as with any medium it should play to its strengths, right? Well, really, sometimes you don&#8217;t play to a medium&#8217;s strengths for a few different reasons. Firstly, maybe you aren&#8217;t good with any other medium. Secondly, perhaps you wish to make a point of using an off-medium. Thirdly, it ultimately doesn&#8217;t matter as long as it works.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, videogames *are* a bit of an odd medium, in that they can include other mediums inside them, due to the miracle of turing complete programming. Videogames have even been known to have other videogames inside them. What&#8217;s more, because of this flexibility, frequently the medium is used in a manner which makes it resemble other mediums. Cutscenes are like short films, text adventures are interactive notvels, etc.</p>
<p>So ultimately I felt it weird that videogames should be treated as just limited to this simulation thing, when they can and will do more than that.</p>

I&#8217;ve been following the Total War series since the very first Shogun: Total War<br />
Then Medieval: Total War, the one I played for the longest period.</p>
<p>Both of the above, despite  their respectively taking place in Japan and Europe at critical points of strife, and having the map and factions to prove it, felt incredibly flat. Literally, in these two, you have an abstracted map of the region, like you had a paper map in front of you, and you move army tokens containing the actual forces around on this map. You pick them up, and put them where you want them. This abstraction, along with relatively light flavor, made the games sort of hollow beyond being a war game.</p>
<p>Enter Rome: Total War, and Medieval: Total War 2</p>
<p>These two overhauled the map system tremendously, now there are actual separate armies (still a single presence on a map) moving and having to pick paths and arrange ambushes and such, rather than literally being dropped into the next province. A lot of flavor starts to come into play, with voice acting and the usage of the Senate and Pope (respectively) as major bodies causing difficulties, it feels more cohesive and drawing.</p>
<p>Enter Total War: Shogun 2 (No I don&#8217;t know why they dropped the old naming formula)</p>
<p>When you start Total War: Shogun 2, this trailer plays as the very first thing after credits: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EQWcB1vXXg</p>
<p>It only delves further into the Japanese feel from there. Every spoken line in the game is, while English, in a mild Japanese accent. Loading screens offer beautiful, simple Japanese paintings with short snippets from The Art of War or haiku poetry or similar. A little Ninja movie plays every time you have someone assassinated, replete with such gems as a Ninja throwing a Kunai to hit his target in the back of the head, the target blocking it with a small fan out of nowhere, a cut to the Ninja with his eyes wide, as if to say &#8220;OH F@$*&#8221;, and subsequently running like a bat of hell, chased by guards. There are epic speeches at the start of battles, delivered with decent context-detection by your commanding officer on the field. E.g., they&#8217;ll have something snide to say about the shortcomings or over-specification of the clan in question, will praise the aid of any present allies, and so on.</p>
<p>All of this detail leaves you transported. It no longer feels as if you&#8217;re playing on a drab abstract map &#8211; most of the map actually is one when you start playing, but as you bring units to uncharted areas, they &#8220;pop&#8221; off the page into a realistic rendering of the landscape. Already obscenely long story short, Total War went from a run-of-the-mill wargame to a game that puts you in the mood of what you&#8217;re doing, and in doing so went from modestly successful to a front-page item on Steam.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take the game Terraria. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+Terraria</p>
<p>Is this game hardcore or casual? It&#8217;s bright and cheery during the day, and zombies will probably feast on your bones the first night. Your method of play completely changes the nature of the game. Whether you&#8217;re sculpting a beautiful castle or murdering bigger and nastier bosses for &#8220;phat loot&#8221;, Terraria lets you have it both ways.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s the fiction? Like I said, varies on what you&#8217;re doing, starts out positive.<br />
Interface? Mostly intuitive. Inventory management only becomes a problem after you&#8217;ve already gotten the hang of it.<br />
Interruptibility? Supremely interruptible. Obviously, less so if you&#8217;re with friends, or if you&#8217;re in the middle of fighting a boss monster.<br />
Difficulty? It starts out easy and gets harder, exactly as proscribed by both types of gamers.<br />
And the rewards are self-evident.</p>
<p>Even better, if you have a &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gamer friend more into the fighting aspects of the game, they can help you with those aspects of the game you&#8217;re not good at or interested in.</p>
<p>So Mister Know-it-all (that&#8217;s me): is this game hardcore or casual?</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t really class it as either. Your experience is tailored to what you want out of it.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to my thesis: Making this hardline distinction between hardcore and casual games is rather limiting.</p>
<p>Of course, some of what I&#8217;ve just said about these distinction is liberal idealist pinkocommie claptrap, and rightly so. Categorism is only &#8220;wrong&#8221; when it makes an incorrect or useless distinction. Probably, we can use this categorism to accomplish exactly what I&#8217;m getting at. &#8220;I shall make a game appealing to BOTH audiences! Hardcore and casual together at last! You got your hardcore in my casual, well you got your casual in my hardcore. . . mmmmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, and those of you who got this far and are wondering, where&#8217;s the Call of Duty? Where&#8217;s the Bejeweled? That was just to draw a parallel. Nothing to see here.</p>

Call it the white man&#8217;s burden, first worlder guilt, whatever.</p>
<p>Guilt is actually the way our society founds itself (the other major societal structure is based on shame), to keep members of said society in line et cetera. This is why we consider those who don&#8217;t feel guilt to be suffering from a serious mental disorder.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that guilt is a natural occurrence in such a circumstance, but it is up to the informed person to decide whether they *should* feel this guilt. Should you take this burden of guilt just because the journalist says so? Probably not.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as with most statistics, it&#8217;s very easy to reinterpret them to suit the particular aims you have, as we&#8217;ve suggested extensively was the case in class.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a little note: Phone Story would have to have been programmed on a computer for which there was just as much guilt to be had.</p>

<p>Certainly, the article makes its point. If Spacewar! is your thing, Spacewar can provide reams of entertainment which may or may not be matchable by modern machines. Spacewar can be found here: http://spacewar.oversigma.com/ and is a two-player game. You can&#8217;t honestly play it by yourself. Still, I can imagine playing spacewar and dealing with the black hole (not present in the original version, added to increase the difficulty) and your opponent providing quite a large chunk of fun, as you and your opponent attempt to outwit and outgun.</p>
<p>A game which I remember coming installed on older computers for some reason is Battlezone, which Atari helpfully maintains a copy of on their website (more advanced than the one I recall playing as a child) here: http://atari.com/arcade/arcade/battlezone As the article suggests, Battlezone was a serious innovation, giving the concept of videogames as more than entertainment, and also demonstrating their actual capacities to the market (even if skirting its actual technological abilities using procedural generation and vector graphics).</p>
<p>You can easily google your favorite copy of Pac-Man, being a ubiquitous game, but it uses a few things which suggest that innovation has indeed helped the industry. Spacewar can be a frustratingly limiting game. It&#8217;s a game with no margin for error, you either shoot your foe or they shoot you, and that will be the end of things, and what&#8217;s more it has to be restarted when a player is victorious, as the game has no provision for multiple matches or lives or score-keeping, which are all elements handleable by the player, but something in this day and age we *expect* from a game.</p>
<p>Getting back to the article&#8217;s point, the gloom-and-doom concept of the video game market crashing is best described as plausible. It could happen again, we can see how it can happen again, and every day you can go to a gaming news site and find yourself some equally stormy prediction about how Call of Duty is Ruining Videogames (http://www.gamejudgment.com/how-call-of-duty-is-ruining-gaming#more-6064). </p>
<p>A lot of discussion amongst myself and my friends, being gamers of different stripes, myself an Xbox360-PC gamer, a friend PS3-360 and a former Gamestop employee, another exclusively PC, and yet another PS3 and handhelds, each of us bringing different arguments to the table, and different evidence, have come to the conclusion that the success or failure of videogames hinges on the WiiU in this upcoming cycle. Evidence for this is of course circumspect, it&#8217;s not as if we went out and properly researched this, but it is a real concern amongst gamers right now, though whether it is with just cause remains to be seen.</p>
<p>A last side note on this: It reminds me of people who compare Rome and America with the intent that &#8220;as Rome fell, so too shall America&#8221; somehow neglecting that the odds of survival for any nation are statistically low, and infinite duration isn&#8217;t plottable.</p>
