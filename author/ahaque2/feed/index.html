But one genre that has been overlooked is interactive fiction. Unlike traditional games, interactive fiction is a text based game that is not concerned with aesthetics or poetics. The focus is on action and reaction by the program to guide you through some world. As Nick Montfort wrote, many view Interactive Fiction as a work of fiction rather than a game of fiction.</p>
<p>Some arguments in favor of interactive fiction being classified a game would be the ability for interactivity of a player with the machine. Player inputs are diegetic actions that define most games. Interactive fiction is played not by randomly typing in words but by using specific verbs. These action words give a sense of “playing” the fiction rather than reading a work of fiction.  Interactive fiction also textually simulates worlds. Videogames are known for simulated reality which parallels interactive fiction.</p>
<p>Unlike a traditional game there are many aspects of “gaming” that is limited or completely excluded in interactive fiction. An interactive fiction is a world that can be explored but has no quest. There is no concept of winning or final replay.  This is similar to the “games” we have explored in the past like driving the bus for 8 hours gives you 1 point but no clear winner, and the Mario clouds game that offer no quest but visual appeal. Would we classify these as games? If so, then should we then consider interactive fictions to be games as well?</p>

The major differences discussed in class were between how games and books raised social and political awareness. Whereas books tell a narrative to identify with a character, games use experiential simulation to give the same effect.</p>
<p>I disagree that story traits and game traits are separate. Rather games use a blend of story traits and game traits to help raise awareness. Because of games ability to tell a story experientially they are capable of teaching history. But as Joseph wrote, “one must be careful with such an approach when it comes to learning about history.” That is because although games are capable of teaching history, fallacious games would do more harm than good. As we saw from the JFK game, the FBI reports score sheet rated no shots higher than missed shots. If altering the past in a video game is acceptable then it does not accurately portray historical events.</p>
<p>If players could kill or save a historical figure in a video game, similar to the JFK game, then it would change the alternate reality based on the player’s performance. I agree that this would “trivialize the value of human life”. From reading historical events we can learn particular sets of values that would be lost in an experiential video game. This sums up the idea that videogames have the potential to raise global awareness for social and political issues but has not come to the point of creating social change.</p>

Visual appearance ties in with the graphics processor and effects are add-ons that simulate reality such as the rumble pack. As discussed in class, the future of videogames is moving towards 3 dimensional game play. With the advancements made to graphics cards and the output screens, one can feel immersed in the game because the texture comes to life.</p>
<p>In the book Bogost states “Developers render the visual aspects of videogames worlds in excruciating detail. But those worlds remain imprisoned behind the glass of our televisions and our monitors”.  I would disagree with Bogost because with the era of 3D televisions, game designers have been racing to create games that can take advantage of the higher output capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://games.yahoo.com/blogs/plugged-in/rumor-next-playstation-coming-2013-200015017.html">http://games.yahoo.com/blogs/plugged-in/rumor-next-playstation-coming-2013-200015017.html</a></p>
<p>Each generation of hardware gets closer and closer to making us feel the simulated experience of gaming by improving visual and musical texture of the game. Sony’s new system that is rumored to begin seeing the market by next year is packed with high end specifications. The “Playstation 4” will come with the AMD Southern Islands graphics processing unit and will be capable of resolutions up to 4096&#215;2160. The system will be able to play 3D games in full 1080. The current PS3has a maximum 3D resolution of 720. What does this mean for us? It means playing in 3D will make a more believable simulated reality. The texture of future games that utilizes these specs will no longer be imprisoned behind the glass of our televisions.</p>

On the other end of the spectrum would be the hardcore players who represent the reverse bias. But after reading the chapter it is clear that the stereotypes of casual players is misleading because studies show that casual players are similar to hardcore players in respects to game knowledge, time investments, and attitude towards difficulty.</p>
<p>The interesting finding was when the article discussed ex-hardcore gamers. The studies showed that ex-hardcore players suited the stereotype of &#8220;casual player&#8221; more than causal players did. The ex-hardcore players would be those who started as young hardcore players during the rise of the video-gaming era. As they grow up they have the same taste in fiction but are unable to invest the same amount of time as they used to and so their attitude towards difficulty changes. If that is the case, is it more appropriate to label ex-hardcore players as casual players?</p>
<p>The article mentions targeting women and stereotypical casual players who enjoy pleasant fictions but what kind of games are gaming industries creating to hold onto ex-hardcore players, who better suit the stereotype of &#8220;casual player&#8221;?</p>

He points out conditions of long working hours, working in isolation, and doing repetitive tasks for low pay. The emphasis on the suicide statistic urges us to feel guilt and care about the situation so we can bring about change.</p>
<p>But why should I feel guilty? This article was far from an ethos based document. Joel Johnson loses credibility after admitting to manipulate Foxconn. What is to say he isn&#8217;t doing the same in his appeals to our emotion. He passionately points to the statistics but as we discussed in class the statistics are actually better than in relation with the rest of China. They have the opportunity to earn a constant wage which they would not have had had it not been for Foxconn and the suicide rate is much lower.</p>
<p>In comparison with America&#8217;s standard of living and working conditions Foxconn is lagging far behind, but if we compare Foxconn with the rest of China they are much better off. It is true that our consumer dollar contributed to these suicides but at the same time it is our dollar that helps a million more families earn a living. By feeling guilt and not buying these products we would be harming more than helping those who work in these &#8220;inhumane&#8221; conditions. I agree with Joel Johnson&#8217;s message to improve working conditions and raise awareness but I disagree with his method. Rather we should try to raise awareness on our ends without guilt tripping consumers. We should advocate workers in Foxconn  and elsewhere to appeal for better working conditions. Change will only happen from within.</p>

One of the reasons leading to the crash not discussed in class that caught my attention was the rise of 3rd party developers. Before the rise of 3rd party developers all games were made by within the company developers. This means Atari made all Atari games. They sold their consoles for cheap hoping to profit on the software sales. With the rise of 3rd parties companys like Activision, consumers would buy games engineered for the Atari console by Activision, but Atari would not be able to profit on those software sales. The US judicial system affirmed 3rd parties right to exist and Atari sales declined. To make matters worse, Atari&#8217;s best programmers left due to low pay and lack of recognition since Atari did not allow credits to show on games. Had the gaming industry not recovered our society would not be as heavily influenced by video games. So as much fun as we have playing video games we should take the time to appreciate the credits at the end of the game instead of turning our system off after beating a game.</p>
