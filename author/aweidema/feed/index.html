Casual games are often looked at as examples of relaxation in video games. If the game is easy (which many casual games are, especially with habitual play) playing the game can almost become second nature and playing it can lead to relaxation. Some casual games that relax me are a version of brickbreaker-  <a href="http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/Arkanoid.html">http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/Arkanoid.html</a></p>
<p>and an online game introduced to me in this class, super mario bros three (ive heard of the game but started playing it regularly after it was assigned for the class) - <a href="http://www.virtualnes.com/play/?id=NES-UM&amp;s=10">http://www.virtualnes.com/play/?id=NES-UM&amp;s=10</a></p>
<p>when a casual game becomes second nature it seems less like an intense game of Call of Duty and more like knitting. Your mind can wander in relaxation, or you can take in and concentrate on other forms of media like music, podcasts or even a tv show on the other side of your computer screen. There are also relaxing games for consoles like Endless Ocean: Blue World (<a href="http://wii.ign.com/objects/142/14286532.html">http://wii.ign.com/objects/142/14286532.html</a>) that lets the player explore a relaxing environment at their own pace. Even though this game requires the same movements of pressing buttons as a more intense game, the guidelines aren&#8217;t as rigid and can provide a relaxing getaway from real life.</p>

By buying the product are we supporting the 12-16 hour shifts and making the quota higher? I believe its safe to say that most of the consumers of our most used electronics really haven&#8217;t thought about where their favorite gadget comes from or how it&#8217;s made so any article like Joel Johnson&#8217;s (<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/02/ff_joelinchina/all/1">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/02/ff_joelinchina/all/1</a>) is a good one. Awareness is a good thing- but now that more and more of the public is finding out about how their xbox is made there needs to be a culture change. I don&#8217;t think many people are going to stop buying the latest electronic product and I think that it&#8217;s silly to think that giant companies aren&#8217;t going to exploit workers in other countries. But how much responsibility should the average consumer take? At least enough to get informed about where our stuff comes from and enough to be able to inform others. The more people that know about our iphones&#8217; origins equals more people that will want to do something about it- maybe pay more for the same product that we know was made by happy, reasonably  worked and payed employees. If we all spread even the basic knowledge that the people making our gadgets are overworked and that it shouldn&#8217;t be that way- we&#8217;re on our way to a better future- and we individually shouldn&#8217;t feel all that bad.</p>

There are often cheats built into games for developers to go through them more easily to work on them. But is that the only time when cheat codes are okay? We brought up the idea in class that a video game reviewer gets a free pass, as cheats simplify the game they need to finish to write a review. Are there any other situations where cheating is okay? In my opinion, no. But the gaming community allows and even encourages macros and add-ons. I believe that macros are even worse than entering a cheat code to get more health or a giant head. One of the main points against cheating is that it wasn&#8217;t in the video game designer&#8217;s vision for how one completes the game. But at least with a cheat, you are still experiencing the diegetic part of the game, going to all the areas and performing all of the actions necessary to complete the game. Macro scripts automate player actions to automatically find items or defeat enemies for the player&#8217;s advantage. With macros, you don&#8217;t even have to play the part of the game that is finding items or fighting bad guys. Not only is it cheating on the same level as entering a code for health, but it takes away from the actual experience of playing. You mess up the artistic vision of the game designer even more because you aren&#8217;t even playing half the game! In my opinion macros should be tolerated as much or less than cheat codes in the gaming community.</p>
