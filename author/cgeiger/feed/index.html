One of the most interesting observations that was made in the article comes from an experiment where there were two objects trying to escape another object. There were two different soundtracks played in the background with two different groups of participants. The participants were asked which character they thought was more active. In both of the different soundtracks the participants found that the character in which the music matched their actions was found to be more active. This led the experimenter to develop the &#8220;Congruence Associonist framework&#8221; in which it is determined that music, in a game or video, can cause the viewer to make visual associations in that media. This is a very interesting concept on how our brain interprets and combines audio and visual signals, and how they both play a role in influencing one another.</p>

As we learned from the documentary that we watched in class on Tuesday, the first video games were created largely from the creativity and curiosity of military engineers. The industry began in order for the engineers to have an outlet for their creativity and a diversion from the stresses of their jobs. These early games largely existed outside of the market as they were not created for profit, strictly for the enjoyment of those who created them.</p>
<p>The industry that we see today is completely different than the industry of the late 50&#8242;s and early 60&#8242;s. Today we see games such as Call of Duty and Madden that release a new title every year with very few changes to the gameplay. Games such as these two, as well as many others, are motivated primarily by profit margin rather than innovation and creativity. I think the reason that games like Call of Duty continue to break sales records without much innovation is because so many people enjoy their multiplayer online gameplay. Many people play online with a group of friends, so if a few of the people in the group get the new version of the game, the rest of the group will usually follow. This is because they will not get the same online experience if they do not get the new version. Their game experience will change not because there is a huge change in gameplay, it will change due to the simple fact that everyone will no longer play the older version and hence their online experience will suffer due to lack of competition online. Whether for better or worse, the video game industry has completely changed.</p>

It covers many different aspects of cheating such as using codes, hacks, outside hardware, as well as cheating in online games using techniques like auto-aim or macros. The article points out that sometimes poor game design prevents the user from completing certain tasks within a game, so the only option is to cheat if you want to complete the game.</p>
<p>Another point that the article makes is that cheating is not always used to make the game easier. Some people use cheat codes or alter the code of the game itself in order to make the game more challenging by making the enemies have more health or better accuracy for example.</p>
<p>Finally, the article makes the distinction between cheating in single player games versus cheating in multiplayer online games. When you cheat in a single player game, you are only changing the game experience for yourself so it is essentially harmless. However, when you use macros or hacks in online games you not only change the game experience for yourself, you may also be infringing on the enjoyment of the other players in the game.</p>
