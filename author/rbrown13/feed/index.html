However, I think that in some ways more hardcore games can be relaxing as well. For example, Team Fortress 2 is a game that I would consider as more of a hardcore sort of game rather than casual, though it has some aspects of casual games such as interruptibility. When I play Team Fortress 2, most of the time it is pretty laidback and relaxing. Once I find a nice server to play on I can zone out and play for hours without realizing it. I also think that games like Dark Souls can be relaxing as well, despite the difficulty of the game. Dying and having to run the same gauntlet again can become methodical and second nature, and I think with more experience in the game it becomes easier to play in a relaxed state. I always just take my deaths in stride, since anything lost in death can be regained, so it is not as stressful as as it seems like it could be at first.</p>
<p>Of course it is also possible to become frustrated in either of these games due to not making progress after repeated attempts, but that is also possible in more casual games as well. I think the key difference is that hardcore games are often harder than casual games, so the player needs to be in the right mindset to be able to relax with hardcore games. If the player is not one to get frustrated with failure then I believe that hardcore games are viable sources of relaxation.</p>

With transportation options like cars and planes, distances become trivial and the ride itself to a new location is not as emphasized as it used to be. Games, however, can recreate the feeling of traveling a long way, along with the feelings of exploration and familiarity that one gains as they travel through the same areas over multiple trips. The game ArcheAge, an unreleased Korean MMORPG, has a large explorable world, but tries to avoid fast travel mechanics that can be found in other games, such as portals or simply mysteriously teleporting to places. Instead, players are provided with a variety of modes of transportation, as can be seen in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLPnOGe0gnE">video</a>. Players can not only ride on animals, but also ride carriages and blimps that come at scheduled intervals. Players can also create boats and then sail them in the ocean to reach other islands, and finally there are also hang gliders that can be used for soaring around. All of these options combined with the scale of the world provide that feeling of embarking on a journey, in ways familiar to us like carriages (well, buses in modern day I suppose) but also in ways that can not be easily experienced in real life, such as hang gliding, blimps, and sailing your own boat.</p>

The role of the movie playing device, formerly filled by DVD players and the like, has been encroached on by game consoles such as the PS3 and Xbox 360. Movie services such as hulu and netflix have also become available through game consoles, further solidifying their roles as general purpose entertainment devices. Game consoles are essentially very specialized computers built just to play games, but as their functions become broader, I believe they will become more and more like regular computers. Simplified web browsers would not be surprising to see, and consoles have offered keyboards in the past so there is no reason they would not be made to allow easier browsing as well.</p>
<p>However, whereas you can upgrade or build a PC yourself, consoles must be bought from the company and not tinkered with at all. Currently console makers do not like people messing with their machines in any way, and I think that trend will continue. By not allowing modifications they make sure that customers will have to buy their next product instead of just having to upgrade certain parts. Also, with consoles there is an ease of access that does not always come with PCs; there is no worrying over parts or specifications to make sure a game runs well. I think that as different platforms become more able to perform others&#8217; roles and lines blur between them, this will become one of the more important distinctions between consoles and computers.</p>

I agree that the fun in designing the games was not just the representation of a ship as a collection of dots in a certain formation, but rather the significance of those dots. Whereas before they would have been some data presented for some work-related purpose, now they took on the meaning of a ship. The imagination necessary in thinking of the dots as a ship was where fun was, as that imagination was absent in using the computer for work related purposes.</p>
<p>However, I also feel that a large portion of the enjoyment from creating games came from the simple feeling of creating something. Making something like a building, food dish, painting, knit sweater, or anything else gives a sense of accomplishment, and it is the same with programming games. But there is also the satisfaction gained from overcoming challenges that contributes to the drive to create. As a computer science student, I&#8217;ve had to do a significant amount of programming, and a lot of the fun is from the puzzle-like nature of figuring out how to design a certain feature. The designers of these early video games must have felt that satisfaction, even more so because there was not really anything similar ever created before. Programming a game of tic-tac-toe can be rewarding when you finish, everything works, and you can say that you created it, but it must feel even better when you are the first one to create a tic-tac-toe computer game. For some, creating the game itself might have been more fun than actually playing it.</p>

They are simply about some unidentified (stick figure) man with fancy pants and a spiky hair cut running around and jumping on things, like spiders and rats with guns. No explanation is really given on why these creatures are sitting around elaborate stages with mysterious pieces of land just floating around, but it is besides the point. The real focus of the game is the running, because of the interesting physics engine that allows for very fast acceleration and various tricks like wall jumps. The satisfaction from this game results in being able to navigate the landscapes at the fastest speed, an example of ilinx, rather than outwitting enemies or saving the world from annihilation.</p>
<p>Espen Aarseth said that games are &#8220;the art of simulation&#8221;, and that that is the cause of enjoyment for the player, rather than the storyline. The second Fancy Pants game even acknowledges this; the game starts with an ice cream cone being stolen by a rabbit and the mayor telling the player to chase after it &#8220;&#8230;for World 2 to have a plot line!&#8221; The developer himself knows that any arbitrary story is fine, and that the players really desire the experience the gameplay provides. Thus these games are prime evidence supporting Aarseth&#8217;s assertion that games should not be analyzed like books, based on story, but rather on other elements such as the experience provided.</p>
