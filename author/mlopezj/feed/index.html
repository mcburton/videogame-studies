Laura Packer first and foremost is a story teller, and a phenomenal one at that. In her presentation she outlined the history of storytelling and how it is the human races first real form of communication, dating back to prehistoric times. Story telling taps into a experiential part of your brain and makes you tap into your experiences and past to help make a story your own.</p>
<p>Ms. Packer told the audience a story about the day she met the devil. The devil didn&#8217;t have red horns or a long pointed tail. The devil also didn&#8217;t smell like brim stone, but rather Channel number 5. This was just the very beginning of her story but as you can see your senses and imagination are already at work. You can almost smell the Channel perfume or brim stone when you are told this information. Ms. Packer never actually tells you what the devil fully looks like but rather gives you little pieces and allows you to fill in the rest. The blank space that she leaves for you to use to create your own image is what she calls &#8220;white space&#8221;. It is this &#8220;white space&#8221; that allows you to become deeply emerged into a story by adding your own twist or perception of it, and in turn makes the story more of your own.</p>
<p>In regards to gaming, she argues that gaming is very good at telling a story, but how good is it emerging you into it and making you own the story yourself. Often video games give you every little detail from the characters outfit to the fight scenes to whats happening and so on. She challenged all the game designers to try to make games that they could leave enough white space somehow in order to make each story their own. She figured the plot of the story would be a good place to start, but she also wasn&#8217;t too sure how this could fully be done. In looking at games with alternate endings based off the choices you make in the game, she found that this was the closest to the idea she was looking for. However, the games endings are not truly all endless based on the players choices. There are a set number. Unfortunately right now we do not have the technology to make a game with a purely infinite number of endings.</p>
<p>In regards to how I felt about her presentation, I loved it. She was very entertaining and engaged the audience in a way that i hadn&#8217;t expected. I would suggest that if anyone gets the chance to listen to her again then they should take that opportunity.</p>

Games that are used more to accurately tell a story of the past than to simply be enjoyed as games. Today you always hear gamers talk about how realistic games are becoming and how the games they play make them feel as if they are right there in the action. No one ever complains about these games being too realistic for them to handle. Now looking at docu-games we see that people call these games &#8220;too real&#8221;. Is this due to some of the sensitive topics such as slavery in &#8220;Flight to Freedom&#8221; or the assassination of JFK in &#8220;JFK reloaded&#8221;? Despite the negative comments about these video games, there is a lot of new information to be learned from them. Games like &#8220;The Cat and The Coup&#8221; tell of past events that you may not have heard of before. This game in particular covers the CIA bringing upon the downfall of a democratically elected leader of Iran.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.interactivedocumentary.net/2011/10/22/the-cat-and-the-coup/">http://www.interactivedocumentary.net/2011/10/22/the-cat-and-the-coup/</a></p>
<p>I know I never knew about an incident like this. I think that if critics looked more at the teaching aspects of these games rather than what is considered to be the insensitivity of the games themselves, then a better market and acceptance of these games can be created.</p>
<p>Here is another link with more docu games thanks to Â Cindy Poremba</p>

Older platforms simply just did not have the physical capability (whether it be a soundcard, or memory) to play many musical tones. As systems progressed, so did the sound. You can clearly see the difference between the 8 bit atari system and the musical sounds in super mario for the nintendo. Later on elaborate music could be added to games once cds came into the video game world with the Sony Playstation. and as systems and speakers became more advanced, the complexity of music in video games was able to increase. This is a case where the physical technology, held back the advancement of the musical performance</p>
<p>Linking sounds and music to the movements of a character has a big part on the way players experience their gameplay. The term &#8220;mickey mousing&#8221; is used to describe this effect. It makes the movements oof characters unforgettable, such as how we all know what is happening in a Mario game just by the sounds we hear and not actually watching the game.</p>
<p>The music in the background of videogames also gives the audience an individual feeling based on Â the tone and sound of the music. For example the happy bubbly music when you are in the Mario Overworld as opposed to the Mario Underworld. Most people feel scared and anxious when listening to the minor chords and sounds in the underworld, causing gameplay to be hastened and less carefree.</p>
