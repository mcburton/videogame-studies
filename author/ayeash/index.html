<p>The most important points of his presentation were his sources of inspiration and strategies for fostering creative and imaginative growth.  He spent time discussing the importance of passion.  The video game industry is tough and competitive. Passion is sustaining and vital, and it is the key ingredient to success, especially to survive the game industry.  It is what will get you up in the morning, and get you through the hard times when inspiration may be low.</p>
<p>When discussing sources of inspiration, Cox said, &#8220;What made your eyes light up as a child still has the power now&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; This quote really stood out to me during the session.  From his presentation, it seemed that most of his inspiration derived from childhood enjoyments and current forms of entertainment such as movies, books, and other video games.  People often forget what it takes to inspire them, but the answer is as simple as looking back into your childhood.  When he mentioned this point, this simple exercise brought me back to the sources of my inspiration, which is something that I have not thought about it a long time.</p>
<p>He brought up some very important points about inspiration within a professional setting.  Collaboration is essential to work in the video game industry.  However, a good strategy to employ is establishing &#8220;circles of trust.&#8221;  These circles are creative and inspirational outlets with trustworthy and supportive people inside and out of the professional environment.  Having &#8220;circles of trust&#8221; enables you to share your passion with other people in a constructive manner.  I thought this was a very valuable and worthwhile strategy for a long term career in the gaming industry or other inspiration-based industries.</p>

<p>Lionsgate, the company which owns the rights to &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; film series is planning on turning the movie into a console videogame. The news article below debates the pros and cons of a videogame release.  There is already a mild facebook version, but the potential of a full scale game has created much controversy.</p>
<p>In summary, &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; is about 24 kids sent to an arena that must fight to the death until there is one remaining victor.  The storyline has great potential for a videogame, but the themes may be too much considering the primary fan following is  middle-school aged kids.  Modern videogames don&#8217;t exactly have a history of being mild, and kids killing kids is a very risky area for a game with such a young audience.</p>
<p>Many who were skeptical of the movie are even more uncertain about a videogame.  “While parents might be able to talk themselves into letting their kids see the movie, because the violence is masked by various PG-13 filmic techniques, there isn&#8217;t much chance of that happening in video-game land,” writes Matthew DeBord on the Southern California Public Radio website.</p>
<p>However, a &#8220;Hunger Games&#8221; videogame could suffer the same fate as many other movie franchise related videogames such as Electronic Arts&#8217; &#8220;Harry Potter.&#8221;  Nonetheless, with the high publicity of the movie, this article predicts the game will be at least mildly successful.  I guess we&#8217;ll have to wait until the game comes out to see its true effect.</p>

Are videogames even art?  The second is a question he addresses in the first sentence of the chapter by which he quotes Roger Ebert.  Ebert says that &#8220;the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Ebert has given a decided opinion, ultimately no one can decide whether or not videogames are art because it depends on what each person&#8217;s individual definition.  Characteristics of art can include form, effect, perspective, skill involved as well as many others.  There are many types of games with varying strengths in these components.  How is good art different from bad art, and what makes each still considered art?  These questions are being applied to videogames, but they are difficult to ascertain.  With the avant-garde movement in the 19th century, these questions have become even more difficult to answer.</p>
<p>Videogames have filled a new niche in art just like film and poetry before it.  Although videogames as a form of art are not yet widely accepted, in a few decades, this stance will most likely change as technology becomes better and videogames continue to embed themselves within society.</p>
<p>Although the question can never be objectively answered, that&#8217;s the whole point.  Art is subjective, and it is the responsibility of the individual to determine the definition of art. Some videogames require immense skill and detail and whether or not they are considered art is up to you.</p>

<p>What I found most interesting is how a particular sound can cause a certain emotion.  There was a lot of discussion in class about why a sound brings about a certain feeling or emotion in someone.  Is it because the sound naturally elicits the emotion or have we been classically conditioned to feel certain ways with the introduction of a particular sound?  Both may be correct.</p>
<p>But the sounds we hear in Mario for instance, such as the coin collection, growing from eating the mushroom, and falling, we only only associate those sounds with those actions because we have been trained to do so, otherwise they hold no meaning.  I&#8217;m sure the makers of Super Mario picked those sounds to try to best capture the action that was being performed.  But how did the makers decide those sounds would fit best?  It&#8217;s the nature vs. nurture / natural or conditioned question all over again.</p>

<p>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/propublica/foxconn-by-the-numbers_b_1237243.html</p>
<p>If you clicked on the above link and read through it, there are some pretty shocking figures.  The suicides are only one number in the many.  Foxconn commits other grosser human rights violations which are almost completely unnoticed by the consumer industry at large.  This article was published January 27, 2012, only a few weeks ago.  Daisey visited the factory back in 2010, and it does not sound like much has changed other than the addition of nets.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t click on the link, below are some thought-provoking highlights that stood out the most to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1.2 million:</strong> number of workers employed by Foxconn in China</li>
<li><strong>12:</strong> Hours in a typical work shift</li>
<li><strong>230,000:</strong> number of workers at &#8220;Foxconn City&#8221; in Shenzhen</li>
<li><strong>70,000:</strong> number of workers at Foxconn&#8217;s Chengdu plant who live in company dorms</li>
<li><strong>34:</strong> continuous hours a Foxconn employee worked in 2010 before he collapsed and died</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, an estimated 40% of the world&#8217;s electronics are manufactured by Foxconn.  With some hard numbers at our side, we can consider ourselves slightly more educated consumers, but with the grasp that Foxconn holds on the global market, will that really make any difference?</p>

<p>Why would someone continue to play a game that is not fun?  For me, &#8220;Upgrade Complete&#8221; was fun because I enjoyed the aspect of being able to improve the quality of the game throughout the game, but for someone else who would not care about the upgrades, the actual game probably would have been boring and too easy.  This game is a great beginning game to discuss because it causes some typical behavior of video game culture.  As Galloway says in the reading, &#8220;people move their hands, bodies, eyes, and mouths when they play video games&#8221; (4).  I noticed that same behavior from myself as I was playing, for example, leaning from side to side as my ship shot at the oncoming obstacles.  Another interesting parallel I noticed was the personification of the video game.  Galloway discusses how &#8220;video games are actions&#8221; (2).  They play and run.  The dialogue, especially in &#8220;Upgrade Complete&#8221; helps magnify this personification.</p>
