He was speaking in order to inspire future game developers or writers, to give them advice and first-hand knowledge on what a job in the gaming industry is like today. He focused on five main takeaways that the audience should remember and utilize in their own careers.</p>
<p>1. Have an Indestructible Passion. Love what you do, and persevere.</p>
<p>2. Have a &#8220;Death Star Exploding&#8221; imagination. Innovative thoughts and their proper application are what sets successful games apart. He gave lists of books, movies, and games which he saw as influential and necessary to being well-read.</p>
<p>3. Know Thyself. Know what you love, what inspires you, what your childhood fantasies were.</p>
<p>4. Share Your Joy. Take your inspirations and fantasies and share them through your art.</p>
<p>5. Have a Circle of Trust. A close group of friends in which you can trust your unfinished ideas and greatest passions. These people can help you develop and review your ideas before you share them publicly.</p>
<p>He views all of these points as key to his successful career, and wishes to share them with the next generation of game developers, who he views as holding the future of the form of gaming in their hands. He finds that art happens accidentally, and comes from entertainment that reaches the next level of form.</p>

As Wikipedia defines &#8220;A <em>core</em> or <em>mid-core</em> gamer is a player with a wide range of interests and enthusiast toward creative and diverse games, but without the amount of time spent and sense of competition of a hardcore gamer.&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer</a></p>
<p>This wide range of games and genres available on each console creates a large number of possibilities for gamer classifications. Even handheld game consoles can be host to casual and hardcore video games. Take into consideration the Gameboy Advance, and specifically two games, Super Mario Bros. 3 and Pokemon Emerald. One could argue that Super Mario Bros. 3 is a casual game, which doesn&#8217;t require much gaming knowledge to play, and offers playability in which the gamer can leave for an extended period of time, and still understand the objectives of the game, to get to the right side of the screen. Pokemon Emerald however, can be argued to be a hardcore game, because of the time and effort needed to successfully play the game, as well as the effort it takes to get back into the game upon returning from an extended break. These two levels of gaming are present in a console marketed for kids, and further blurs the lines between casual and hardcore.</p>
<p>Nintendo&#8217;s next console, the Wii U, is marketed for these &#8220;Mid-Core&#8221; gamers, who favor creativity and have wide ranges of interests in games and genres.</p>

Davis refuted this argument, and was mostly right in saying that the music industry would not be hurt by video games, but he was wrong in his title, as three years later, &#8220;Super Mario Bros&#8217;&#8221; was released and made history with its iconic music and sounds.</p>

<p>The paper above was written by a Yale student in 1999, and includes many interesting facts about the rise of video games and their music. Written around the time in which &#8220;Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time&#8221; was released (1998), the paper offers an interesting point of view during the time of the first solid video game scores.</p>
<p>In present day, some video game scores can be as involved as movie scores, but have they crossed the gap and become &#8220;stand alone&#8221; music, capable of competing in the music industry? Many movies release their soundtracks, and generate large amounts of profit from it, could video games start doing this in a big way? Blizzard is already starting to release soundtracks for their games, and the Halo franchise has generated a lot of buzz, the soundtrack for Halo 3 is the highest grossing video game soundtrack on Itunes.</p>
