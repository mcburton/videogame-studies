I do not find interactive fiction to be a videogame, regardless of whether or not it was intended to be one. Making it through the presented fictional story and memorizing the different commands felt like more of a chore rather than a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>The one thing I do appreciate about these games is their history. Because some of the first interactive fiction games have been around since the 1970&#8242;s, like <em>Adventure</em>, it feels as though I am getting a raw and classic experience. It makes me feel as though I am interacting with the basic logistics of a computer more so when compared to a complex modern videogame. Although I do see why interaction fiction generates interest, its not an experience that I will ever strive to obtain.</p>

This included anything from the Challenger disaster to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. It was argued many times that older events that occurred before our lifetimes would feel more comfortable if a videogame was made about them. I do not think this is entirely true. I believe that it mainly depends on which disastrous events in history are emphasized to be the most sensitive. These events can be different for any given person.</p>
<p>There has been wide public backlash faced by games such as <em>JFK: Reloaded</em>. But games like Call of Duty that allow players to fight as terrorists and kill Americans do not receive that sort of backlash. Therefore, I do not think historical relevance has that much to do with controversy generated by videogames made about sensitive events. Subjects of all kinds will continue to be presented in videogames. I do not think any sort of line can really be drawn as something that takes things too far. Because they are games, people do not have to actually play them. Just like books and movies, people have a choice as to what they want to expose themselves to. I predict that even more games about events like these will be made in the future.</p>

<p>In class on Tuesday, we talked extensively about how video games can be relaxing. Personally, I find video games to be relaxing when they provide the player with a pretty simple task. It becomes relaxing for me when performing that simple task in a video game allows me to completely focus entirely on the game while forgetting outside events or pressures. It is perfectly fine for the game to be challenging at some points, as long as the actions performed in order to play the game are very simple and understandable.</p>
<p><em>Sugar, Sugar </em>is a game that I find to be pretty relaxing. The controls and objectives are very easy to comprehend, but the game becomes more challenging as the player advances to further levels. The background music that accompanies the game also adds to its relaxing feel.</p>

<p>First, the author states that &#8220;casual games&#8221; are often built to be less complex and played for shorter periods of time than &#8220;hardcore games.&#8221; A representative of Nintendo even stated that many games for the Wii are downplaying the importance of graphics and other complexities of games in favor of simplicity in order to adhere to a broader audience of players. If games like these for the Wii and Xbox&#8217;s Kinect are indeed supposed to be less complex, then why do they still cost $50, which is similar to more &#8220;hardcore games&#8221; such as Skyrim or Battlefield? Is it because of the interactive technology required for the Wii controller or Kinect sensor to work? Personally, I choose to spend a certain amount of money on a new video game based on how much time I plan on playing it. I would love to purchase new Kinect games, but I am not willing to throw down $50 for a game that I would only casually play on an infrequent basis.</p>
<p>The author also mentions that casual games must have the ability to be played for both short and long periods of time. Players of the Rock Band games are able to play just a song or two for ten minutes, or they can also play for longer periods of time in game portions such as the &#8220;Endless Setlist,&#8221; where the gamers play all the songs in a row in one setting. This provides ideal entertainment for different players of casual games who spend varying amounts of time playing video games.</p>

The sheer size of the factory as well as the huge amount of people working in an assembly line-like process is something I have never witnessed here in the United States. I also agree with others that the working hours for the employees of this company are unnecessarily high and should receive notice on the international stage. However, even though I am an owner of an iPhone, I do not feel personally responsible for the poor working conditions of these employees. I do think that knowing the background of how our electronic devices are made is important, and I also believe that knowledge of potentially unfair working conditions for the people assembling these products should be shared. But it is not going to prevent me from buying these new devices.</p>
<p>I found the discussion we had in class regarding the availability of other jobs to Chinese citizens to be quite interesting. A point was argued multiple times that the majority of the people living in China do not have access to a job as stable as the one held by many of the employees of the Foxconn factory. Based on the arguments made in class and the fact that China is a nation of over a billion people, I believe that a job at a place like the Foxconn company provides enough needs and benefits in order to satisfy the majority of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>In class on Tuesday, we discussed how some series of videogames today are releasing new games on a consistent basis without actually making much change between the new and old games. This article talks about the music/rhythm videogame genre and ponders what the future will hold for these types of games. The author does a good job of listing the seemingly endless amount of <em>Guitar Hero </em>and <em>Rock Band </em>games that have been made. However, I wish the author had provided more insight as to what changes could be made to these games in the future. His theory simply appears to be that subtle improvements will continue to be made as new games come out, such as the addition of new songs. I wish that this article contained more outlandish desires or predictions as to what could be done in the future with these games in order to end the status quo. Something I hope that could be done with these games in the future is for them to be able to take songs from an Mp3 player and convert the music into playable tracks on the game. In his closing remark, the author makes the commonly used suggestion that fans of these games should actually try and learn real instruments.</p>
