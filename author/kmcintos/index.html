I&#8217;ll be going, fingers crossed, into the games industry as a game artist, but I&#8217;ve had a little taste of game writing in one of Seth Hudson&#8217;s classes and I really like it. Laura Packer&#8217;s morning workshop was a good way to ease into the day. The woman is a very talented storyteller, and the creative exercises she had us participate in really began renewing my interest in creative writing, which I haven&#8217;t done in a while. She had us doing goofy improv games in groups to stir up ideas and create some really off-the-wall stories. What she stressed, here, was the importance of having a group to brainstorm with and bounce ideas off of, because collaboration is really where the best story elements are conjured in conjunction with improv; we&#8217;ll often come up with more novel ideas when put on the spot in a group setting and BSing the next line of a narrative.</p>
<p>The importance of having a group of people to bounce ideas off of was a point emphasized also by Rowland Cox. He stressed the importance of having a &#8220;circle of trust&#8221;; a group of people who will listen to you and give you constructive criticism on your ideas. The industry can be cruel, and maturing your ideas with a small group of others first and thickening your rhino skin will help you succeed more in the industry. The biggest thing he talked about, though, was passion. You&#8217;ve got to love what you do. You&#8217;ve got to know what you love about it. You&#8217;ve got to be able to pull from an arsenal of references, whether they be textual, gamic, or filmic in nature, to get across to others what you love. This probably hit truest to what I lack currently. I have a huge passion for video games (and making them), and going to see all the recent Marvel films in sequence before I watch the Avengers already makes me giddy as a kid on Christmas day, I haven&#8217;t thought too deeply about why I love what I love. The passion&#8217;s there, I just need to find it&#8217;s source, and I relish that advice. Anyway, I really liked that he asked the audience members questions, too, engaging them in conversation. It was refreshing and the atmosphere was nice.</p>
<p>Ken Rolston, though, wow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been to such an energetic presentation before. He was honest, he was fun, he was unafraid, and he shone as brightly as the sun with lethal positivity. He stressed a lot of things- the importance of collecting literature, flyers, etc. to use as references, learning from tabletop games, maintaining an excessively positive attitude in the workplace to get what you want, failing fast, hard, and dramatically, stealing stuff, and the power of donuts. It was incredibly fast-paced, and he had a lot of information to give, but what I absorbed was very helpful and I have a lot of respect for the man. He terrifies me just a wee bit (that extreme positivity and confidence helps, I think) but I admire the way he operates and I think that&#8217;s something to aspire to. He came out of retirement to keep working on and perfecting games; you can see that he loves what he does.</p>

He touches briefly on the hidden sex scenes in <em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas </em>and <em>Mass Effect</em>, but then goes on to talk about earlier sex-themed videogames from decades past in the United States. Later he talks at length about modern sex-themed games with a focus on Japanese hentai or eroge games. Over all, he makes the point that these games may not entirely be for the achievement of pleasure through an interactive, digital medium, but more for the achievement of a sense of discomfort in confronting the perversions enjoyed by other people or cultures. In other words, we might find Japanese interactive porn to be very disturbing, but elsewhere others might find the very detailed (well, as detailed as you could get at the time) porn games of our Atari age to be just as disturbing.</p>
<p>While I appreciate his scope of going into the past and across the seas in discussing this subject, I feel as though the chapter might have benefited from discussing more modern games in North America. I was really surprised he didn&#8217;t talk about the Sims games, to be quite honest. The whole concept of being able to make &#8220;woohoo&#8221; with another sim is something that I remember being quite controversial a number of years back. These games were out before this book was published, but not the Sims Social, a facebook game that enables you to play a 2D version of the Sims games with friends on the social networking site. What makes this different, though, from the other Sims games is that it has no (visible) rating. The other Sims games are rated T for teen because of the sexual aspects of the game and parents are able to monitor that. But anyone can have a facebook account, and therefore anyone of any age can play the much more cartoony and family-friendly looking Sims Social, yet I have heard no controversy over it at all. Could it be said, then, that games involving sexual content are becoming less controversial as they grow in numbers? Are things different now than from 7 years ago when <em>GTA: San Andreas </em>was criticized?</p>

The motivation, this First Reader claims, is to escape reality, and that can be applied to both casual and more hard core games. It&#8217;s the level, or, rather, entirety to which one wishes to escape the everyday that makes the difference between a casual gamer and a <em>gamer. </em>Someone looking for a quick distraction from the mundane might turn to a 5 minute game on his or her iPhone, whereas someone looking to escape into another reality altogether might turn to a more serious and time consuming game. Isn&#8217;t this escape from reality essentially the &#8220;Zone&#8221; we talked about later in class? Classmates talked a lot about getting &#8220;in the Zone&#8221; while playing a more serious game, one person expressing the feeling as being reached when you just become the controller, so to speak. I noticed that no one really spoke the same way about casual games where the flow can be broken and reassumed at will, because it is a distraction from reality. The level of immersion in the virtual reality of more serious games that classmates claimed to achieve while in the &#8220;Zone&#8221; definitely coincides with a fuller escape from reality that this First Reader connected, correctly, I think, with more serious games. We might be onto something there.</p>
<p>One other post by a First Reader that was brought up in class but not really discussed was the similarity in prices for casual and serious games for consoles. The point made was that casual games tend to have less appealing graphics and simpler mechanics when compared to more serious games, so why should they be priced the same? One thing I guess we haven&#8217;t discussed much (I&#8217;ll go off on a tangent here) is the replay value of a game. Take any of the more recent Final Fantasies, for example. You can log over a hundred hours on one game before you finish it, but once you&#8217;ve finished it, that&#8217;s it for most people. Making it to that hundred hours can be a challenge, too, especially if you take long breaks in between gameplay. Forgetting where you&#8217;re at and what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing when you finally return to it might lessen your motivation to continue the game. A casual console game, however, even though it may be played in short sessions, can rack up even more hours than that because it&#8217;s easy to pick up, easy to replay, and the gameplay is simple and relatively mindless. The hours my family has collectively gotten out of Wii Sports trumps those spent on my most favorite RPGs. Conclusively, in terms of how much entertainment you will get out of a game, casual and serious games are pretty competitive, so I think it&#8217;s reasonable that these games can be similarly priced.</p>

<p>Above is a link to a portion of the 1934 Chinese silent film <em>The Goddess. </em>In its pivotal scene, there&#8217;s a switch to a shot (starting at 6:14) that employs the first-person perspective that puts the audience in the shoes of the scumbag character who is about to get what&#8217;s coming to him from the main protagonist. I thought this might be interesting to share because it is a very early example of the subjective shot used in cinema to elicit a general feeling of uneasiness and sudden self-awareness in a film. Contrary to first person shooters, where the perspective immerses the player in the game, this particular shot is jarring. Camera movements in the silent film days were very limited- in this film, the camera doesn&#8217;t really move at all with the exception of this scene where it tracks backward ever so slightly, giving the illusion that the antagonist is leaning backward, yet paralyzed, and really making this shot exceptional. The protagonist stares directly into the camera, breaking that fourth wall, and breaks the bottle on the camera. It cuts away, back to a third-person view, to show the damage and never resumes a first-person shot. In this case, the shot is used very impactfully and artistically, but if the entire movie had been filmed in such a way it would lose that impact.</p>

This, it is explained, is why <em>Ping</em>-<em>Pong</em> was more successful than <em>Computer Space- </em>because Ping-Pong, as a tabletop game, was a familiar pastime with the general population and the more futuristic space theme was completely new. I think the popularity of these &#8220;rear-view mirror&#8221; games is still prominent today. The Wii practically banked on it. The system itself came initially packaged with <em>Wii Sports</em>, a hugely popular game in which you played casual sports through the Wii&#8217;s interactive interface with the motion sensitive &#8220;Wii-mote&#8221; and nunchuk. Sticking with the familiarity of these casual sports, the <em>Wii Sports </em>was able to reach a much bigger audience, focusing on families as consumers and not simply the serious gamers. Had they packaged the Wii with another game, say, a new, innovative puzzle game that made similar use of their motion sensitive and infrared technology, it is highly likely that they would have polarized their target consumers. Even if a shooter had been packaged with it, not all &#8220;non-gamers&#8221; can identify with that. They made an incredibly smart move with that and, coupled with the emergence of casual games on smart phones, have moved the market into casual gaming and greatly expanded their reach in terms of consumers; now anybody can be a gamer. The Xbox Kinect and Playstation Move followed suit, trying to appeal to larger demographics. What does this mean for &#8220;serious&#8221; platformers, though? Will we see a lull in their production? Will we see more and more casual games, more available and familiar to us, until we get tired of them and usher in a second era of ground-breaking platform games? We&#8217;re at a very interesting point in game history right now, and it will be interesting to see how things unfold in the future.</p>
